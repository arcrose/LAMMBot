Hah. You said small and you meant small.
Also, howdy.
I'll just idle for ab it, then.
BBC Basic in school, Perl hacking, C++, BASH, Python, Haskell, Lisp. I worked with embedded systems for a while and picked up some C and ASM.
No, I guess not.
I'm sure I could, although there really are many great resources out there for anybody interested in using some Google-fu.
When I learnt to program it basically meant copying code out of books.
What do you use to collaborate?
Yes, you should really get a github account.
I worked with some people from /g/ on a game concept back in September, although eventually it becamce clear that I was the only programmer.
What's SICPbot written in?
Well, you seem like you have the right attitude, anyway.
IRC bots are one of my first projects whenever I look at a new language.
And then web scrapers.
Perl is handy-dandy.
Why don't you host it on github?
Well, I'll be happy to provide bugfixes and code tidy-up on projects if you host them with git or mercurial.
And I'll even comment my code and explain changes I make.
Yes, I'm aware that some people find it daunting.
Although I believe github have a reasonably thorough tutorial?
Clever bot.
Hey, I have to dash out for a bit. I'll be back later, though, and I'll idle and read logs.
I notice that a lot of guys named a very specific shade of pink "salmon."
No doubt the pink t-shirt wearing crowd.
You can do it. I believe in you.
Give the bot a CLisp interpreter.
SICPBot, (defun sq (x) (* x x ))
That would be cool, too.
#232323
The other thing being an embedded lua interpreter?
Careful, that's actually shaping up to be something handy.
I see no spewing.
Maybe all of my statements are too pithy.
HAH
It know better than to quote me.
YAY
Sounds like you need to fix your regex to cut out whitespace.
Hrm?
Mm. You could be a lot cleaner with it if you used a regex, though.
Different strokes for different folks. I'd have done it with one line, personally, and gotten the function to call and an argument.
So, I hate to sound like a broken record but when are you going ot put this up on github?
Git's super-duper easy.
EVAL/APPLY
Hah. I like it.
Well, bad news and good news.
The bad news is that thunar crashes the window manager I wrote when you do a keypress.
The good news is now I know how to work with Xlib atoms correctly and I can make it work properly.
And then I'll have a fully functioning window manager ready for first alpha release.
Actually, it's not tiling *or* floating.
Nope. It's got a unique method of dealing with windows.
Each monitor has a stack of windows. Whenever a window is active it is fullscreen.
Holding down the mod key brings up a numbered list of windows. Pressing a number key switches to that window.
Mod+left/right moves left and right around monitors.
Mod+shift+left/right moves windows to other monitors.
Yes.
Which is basically how I use tiling window managers.
No window decoration or bars visible during normal use. 100% pixel usage.
Yes, exactly. It's designed with multimonitor setups in mind.
Although I think it would work quite nicely on netbooks with tiny little screens as well.
I really like 1 window per monitor.
Still, it's really nice to basically make your own ideal and personalised window manager. Never be niggled again.
Ouch. hard drive failures are never nice.
Sounds like damaged sectors.
If you use ext3/4 and use badsectors your OS won't try to write to the problem I/O areas.
Extremely common on laptops. I literally had to fix something similar for my girlfriend last week.
Honestly, if you run badblocks you'll be able to tell when it finds troublesome sectors because it will look like it's come to a halt.
If you do that use fsck and you'll have to look in the manpage for the badblocks check and automatic fix.
It'll take fucking HOURS but it will fix everything. My girlfriend's 500GB hard drive took almost 12 hours and it wrote off 200MB of bad blocks.
You need to tell it to check for bad blocks. A hardware check rather than just a filesystem check.
Ah, I found the flag for you.
fsck -cc
But remember that you have to do that on EVERY filesystem you create on that device.
Yes, the first c is a read-only bad block check and you want to do a read AND write check. That's -cc.
Yes, it is.
Seriously something like 12 hours.
Is this in a laptop? This is the kind of damage normally done by the i/o head coming into contact with the platter after a power failure.
:S
Yes, but I've seen worse.
Yeah, uh... Don't.
You'll short the caps.
With even a tiny bit of impurity.
Yes, you really can just pump out all of that insulating dust and fluff.
#4f6f77
#9a2288
Mmm. Ubuntu purple.
#9a2288
Ah, I see.
Yes, a single line would be preferable.
Looks like it.
bachelorfrog.jpg
Not that I can comment. I'm doing the same tonight.
Ah, it's 5 here.
It's easy to end up staying up all night programming. There's always just a LITTLE more to do.
Yes.
Ah, a fine country.
Right, I'm out. catch you guys soon.
Word up.
Check it:
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/EX-N
It has my own monitor setup hardcoded at the moment. It's my next TODO item.
Make X11 set up the monitors based upon individual setups rather than require hard coding.
I'd rather have the program detect Xinerama/X11 options at runtime.
That seems to be fairly standard amongst the window managers I've seen and I'm sure it's for a reason.
Nope.
OK, time to jump back out of irssi and get back to fucking around with window management...
Word up.
Absolutely. It's stable and functional.
My todo list is considerably shorter.
Just a couple more things to go and all the basics are done.
And then I can start with the onscreen display and really unique stuff.
Yes, very much like that.
Task switcher and a taskbar that come up while you hold down the mod key.
If you look at the commit history you'll probably be able to pick up on some things to avoid, too.
I didn't want to use linked lists but and made a mistake in trying to use arrays early on.
Ended up using linked lists. There's a reason everybody uses them for windows, apparently.
And Xlib is quirky but actually quite nice to work with once you get started
Yes, although they don't go easy on you.
http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/
Yes, it's 500 lines.
I was hoping to do the core (up to beginnging the bolt-on OSD, which I want to make optional at compile-time) at under 400SLOC.
HackTASTIC.
It really is a fantastic language.
Really? So much is based on C that I thought everybody could at least take a guess.
It's much less forgiving, though.
And you really need to learn how to deal with core dumps because SEGFAULTS will become the bane of your life.
Memory management is the best bit.
Honestly, it'll take you 2 minutes ot learn memory management.
Do you know pointers already?
Well, I don't blame you anyway. It's hard to get into -- especially if you've been using Windows.
Brofist.
Oh, well.. I guess you have no excuse then
Hah.
Well, I've always found that if you do webdev right you get to do some interesting things.
Haskell is brilliant. if you get a chance (or the incling to learn a functional language) then learn that.
Oh, I recently retired my site, actually.
Although I might start hosting code projects on it.
www.kingkill.com
To be honest, I just made a PHP structure and got bored of it.
How do you feel about PHP?
I basically did the same thing.
Yeah, see, funny thing is that I did the same thing with Javascript that I did with PHP -- learn a bit and then move on.
Until I need it for something, of course.
So, how are your own projects going?
No more hacking on the bot?
Thought any more about sharing it on github?
I'd quite like ot see how you've implemented it.
Yeah, it's like a page.
Hah.
No better way to learn than to just get stuck in and host a project.
Nobody'll blame you if you make mistakes and probably the worst that could happen is that you have to delete your project from github and re-upload.
We can create a group.
So we'll all have separate accounts and control merges for our own projects.
FUCK.
How did I manage to break window switching?
Hah.
And you're just sitting there thinking "I didn't go anywhere NEAR window switching..."
Do you have a github account?
OK. When you do we can sort out a group.
Yes.
It would be better for everyone to have their own account.
Because every account has an individual SSH key and other associated problems.
If you go to your account settings and select the "Organisations" tab.
You can choose to create a new organisation.
And I believe you can create projects as attached to the organisation if that's what you want to do.
NeckBears
A bit childish and in-jokish, though.
Gentoomen sounds cool.
Are there any other active people involved with this channel? So far I think I've just seen the 2 of you.
Alright, I need to drop out of irssi for a second to sort out this little bug. brb
Yay, fixed.
Apparently I managed to delete a "
Have you created the project already?
Don't fret too much. Just follow their step-by step and I'll jump in if you need help.
Ah, just pick out the files you want rather than adding them all.
git add file1.pl file2.pl README
And you can just keep adding to the project like that.
OK, did you upload the public key already?
In the menu on the left is a "SSH Public Keys" option.
OK, if you click "Add a key" and copy the contents of ~/.git/id_rsa.pub to it.
Git commits over SSH.
And when you use SSH github will ask for the original key that matches the public one you have them (located at .ssh/id_rsa).
Git will use that automatically and hey presto, you're securely connected and tranferring files.
When you go to commit for the first time, SSH will ask you if you want to add their fingerprint to know hosts.
And it will show that fingerprint to you so that you can compare.
It's to mess with man-in-the-middle attacks.
Run ssh-keygen.
.ssh/id_rsa
But you just said .ssh/id_rsa wasn't found?
Oh, I misread.
Ahhhh.
My bad.
I did mean ~/.ssh/
I'm not sure which stage you're at.
Yup. Just pick out the files you want to add.
git add file1 file2 file3 file4 ...
Yes.
Once you've picked out the files you can do "git commit -a"
It'll drop you into a text editor and will expect you to give a commit message as the first line.
All files with changes to the commit.
Only the files you've added with "git add", though.
Yes, you'll see.
In the text file it show you it details the files ot be added.
If you want to cancel just leave the message blank and it'll driop you out without making a commit.
So basically what you'll get in that text file will be a list of all the files you added with "git add" because they all need to be committed as new.
No.
Especially not binaries or .o files.
That's bad form.
Ah, I don't know about those.
I would assume not, though.
Nope.
God fucking BLESS git for saving me that hassle.
Prepend.
The first line of the file should be your commit message.
It adds that as a place to sync to.
And then, finally and gloriously, "git push origin master"
And then congratulations on your first git commit.
^5
Those 3 steps will be your friends until the end of all time.
add, commit, push.
Hah. Yes, occasionally.
pull, make, merge.
And that's pretty much everything you'll need ot know to be part of the really quite amazing online coding community.
After your first merge you can officially call yourself a collaborative coder.
Python's beautiful god DAMN.
C can be beautiful and elegant in its implementation and handling of data but it can get pretty gosh-darned UGLY at times.
Also, whevere you want to create a stable release: "git archive -o whateverv0.3.tar.gz HEAD"
Hah. yes, I know that feeling.
"Write it all once and then scrap that and write it all again" is a popular technique, apparently.
I believe the reasoning goes that you have to do everything wrong the first time to make a masterpiece.
Well, it's official. EX^N is now my default window manager.
The good news is I just found a bug.
Later, dude.
Oh boy, here comes another one...
Well, defining the problem's the first step, I guess.
So, another all-nighter for you?
Yes, I do know what you mean.
Although I also find it very difficult to stop when I'm on to a really good coding session.
Need a break, though.
neet?
Ah, I should have know.
Sounds like your typical /g/entooman.
Mm. Apathy is the domain of the very bright and the very dim.
I don't know... I spend pretty much every waking hour in front of my computer but I do love a trip to the pub.
It happens.
Hah. I was telling my girlfriend about the Ballmer peak just yesterday, actually.
Not that I think she was particularly following. She was being polite about it, though.
Yeah, I hate staring at a big, white screen.
I did not know this.
So it's not reproducable?
Also, brb 2 secs.
Ahhh, that would make sense.
No, they have to request.
And you make the merges.
brb 1 second.
My word I'm a goddamned bug SLAYER.
Hah. I know that feeling.
it will work fine.
It creates its config files at /path/to/your/source/.git/
Yes.
I have ~/git/
Yeah, anything like that.
Everybody has their own way.
Yeah, it makes sense.
Right, I'm going to try and at least get a couple of hours sleep.
I'll catch you tomorrow, man.
Good afternoon, everybody.
'Afternoon, all.
Word.
How are the projects going?
I took a little break. X11 and Atoms were beginnign to fry my brain.
That, plus I did a couple of all-nighters working on it and I can't be doing that every other day.
So I wrote an SDL pixel unsticker.
Yeah. You ever had a stuck pixel on your monitor?
Like a pixel that'll just sit at 100% green or 100% red.
It's a kind of dead pixel.
Ah.
Well, basically the program generated random switches between 100% red, 100% green and 100% blue.
It's been known to unstick pixels on new monitors.
Just start it running, place it over your dead pixels and leave it for 15 minutes.
Yes.
Threw in a bunch of extra flags for the hell of it because why not.
Make it act as a wget daemon to email web pages to you.
Yar
Then maybe RMs will join the channel.
And help with your bot.
'Afternoon, all.
4chan image numbers are seconds since the UNIX epoch.
Post numbers are sequential.
Also, I have a nice 10-line Perl script for downloading Perl inamges if you're in need.
Also also, I believe the last 3 digits are to stop procedural downloading of the images.
http://ompldr.org/vNzA1cg
Just use the thread or board url as an argument.
e.g. "./4ChanImages.pl http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15389434"
Shush, SICPBot.
Yup. Curl is also balling for ripping images.
Hola.
You'd want to jump straight into that?
I was thinking more babby's first embedded system.
How to get started.
Ah, so you mean you'd like to basically do a lay-it-all-bare "how things actually work" type tutorial.
I don't know FreeDOS, but between us I think we could probably put together a good guide.
I was thinking it might be nice to run over some simple things like board/microcontroller examples that show how a keyboard is designed and programmed.
I'll have to look into FreeDOS.
You have access to them?
Sweet.
Bookmarked.
So you did most of your dev from DOS?
Yes, I see.
Sorry, stepped away for a second.
Launchpads are such cute little boards. <3
I know people who learnt embedded systems on giant boards like the Arcom TITAN and ZEUS.
Nowhere near as fun and I don't think you get to appreciate the kind of skill involved in 4-bit and 8-bit development.
Is this the ting with the voucher code?
Yes, I think it's expired now.
Annoyingly.
Yeah. Annoying because I was busy over the holiday period and didn't see it.
I'd love to get my hands on free dev boards.
The more the better.
Still, those would have been the ideal way to show people how to make their first programs.
Show people how to make it flash out SOS or their name in morse code or something.
Or every minute flash out the time in binary.
Yeah, I saw that.
I cna imagine that's something else that puts people off.
Dev boards are literally just circuit boards.
Hahaha.
Didn't see the processor clock speed at first.

$30 for the blue one and $20 for the red.
I should be making money from these kinds of things.
Absolutely, manhose.
You're making a profit of $15/unit.
Tech + Fashion = Profit.
Macfag "geeks" will buy fucking anything.
I also really need to get myself registered as a business so that I can put all of my dev gear down as an expense.
Get my VAT back.
Bahhhhhhhhh
But you really want to make yourself a cool belt buckle and you're going to learn?
If you're interested in systems/driver programming then the material is all available for you.
I think people just assume it's a lot harder than it is.
You can pick up a launchpad for like $5.
>For $4.30, the LaunchPad includes a development board, 2 programmable MSP430 microcontrollers, mini-USB cable, PCB connectors for expandability, external crystal for increased clock accuracy, and free & downloadable software integrated development environments (IDEs) – everything you need to get started today.
Link?
Also, it could be worse -- he could be using Mindstorms.
Ooh. I was looking at a TS-7200 the other day.
I actually don't think they're expensive for what you get.
Man, I wish that guy with the TS-7200 would post again with an asking price.
Already did once.
I'll give it 5 and then bump again.
If he's in the U.K. or can arrange reasonable shipping I'd actually consider buying it.
Sounds like something to add to the bugfixes list.
Sounds like you've already figured out the fix.
Did you say before that you weren't using regexes?
:S
I think regexes are just downright gorgeous.

I think I might have an old battlestation pic I can show.
I try to avoid the threads, however, as materialism is somewhat of a trap.

Play everything.
Hah.
Well, I don't really use my mouse.
Not really. Sometimes I get a hankering to play Icewind Dale.
I've also got an EeePC 1005P and Mini-ITX based fileserver I use on a regular basis.
I find it almost impossible to work with a single monitor nowdays.
in fact, my window manager is written entirely for multi-monitor setups.
I should have done what everyone else does and had a pile of tech books in my photo.
At least I got my ROTJ poster in.
Wait, what? No tech books?
Gotta have yourself some tech books.

Hey, Manhose, what's the lowest data bus width you've worked with?
I really, really love working with tiny controllers.
I'm looking at making some kind of gifts for people and back when I was at uni I made a dozen calculators.
Little 4MHz RISC microcontrollers with 8Bit data bus, 16Byte RAM and 384 Byte program memory.
How so?
Just a custom stylesheet?
Please tell me you're going ot darken it...
Want.
This is something you made?
Well, keep me informed.
Hah. Google style.
SICPBot needs a filter.
So that he doesn't try and retrieve pagenames from urls than end with an image extension.
I might do a patch if I get around to it.
Should be a little 5 minute job.
It's on my todo list.
Never even heard of Cam4 before.
Oh dear.

Amazingly, I have never been banned from any board for any reason.

I know that off by heart because it's the first thing I do after "Hello world" for every language I tinker with.
Pastebin your code?
That's a really odd way of doing it, man.
Why not use % ?
OK, I figured it.
You add the same number multiple times, imMute.
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it gets added twice.
Change the first line to "for i in {1..999};
Why would you be using a ton of stack for fib?
PROTIP: Use a recursive funtion for a million man points.

You gonna create a nice, big juicy array?
Hugely inefficient, but there's something I like about doing it that way.
Possibly because most of the time I have to write a program that works through a sequence of numbers I tend to need them again later.
I believe in you.
Ooh. Close.
Yup.
Very efficient.
You wrote that very quickly, too.
I <3 perl.
Man, that school thing from yesterday is a) Hilarious and b) The fault of the school for having such shit security.

Oh, Tab. I did constructively criticise.
I told you much of your code was redundant and would be better served as functions.
Sure I did.
>Huge amounts of redundancy. Huge blocks of text. Bad coding. Bad organisation
First one I clicked.
read a book.
Tab's mad because his code's bad.
No, I think I just said it once.
Well, I hope you feel better for having ranted, Tab.
http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15476101
I don't have any grudge.
If the program you had posted wasn't so huge and inaccessable I would have picked out specific points.
It's the way the classes are written more than the number.
What's there to know? You can pick up the basics in 2 hours reading through the GNU documentation.
Feel better, now?
Good.
Maybe you should put as much effort into writing nice, neat and maintainable code as you do defending it.
You'd be a great coder.
That's right.
Sure, I have. My code is as openly available to criticism as your own.
I posted my github. You're wlecome to slag down my code.
It's much neater than your, though.
Well, if you're going to be mad at me for an imagined slight I may as well be a dick right back.
Because even a person who'd never dealt with anything but PHP can se the redundancy.
And the bad formatting.
Link your github again, Tab?
I'll pick out some redundency for you so you can be happy.
Oh, lets not get carried away with ourselves though. I have no intention of having any constructive conversation with you regarding it.
You're too much of a whiner.
Why ARE you here?
I'm just reading through your giant RegexKitLite.m
So strip it down. It's huge.
CKPost.m was the file I posted, I believe.
Didn't you already admit that it was awful?
I'm going to download it and look at it in vim. In its 300-lines-in 300-lines-out form it's completely unreadable.
Why are you only pushing changes every 2 weeks?
And you wouldn't like a decent list of revisions?
One commit
"GIANT CHANGES -- READ CHANGELOG" on every file.
That's not how you use git.
...
CkPost.m lines 131 through 244.
Awful redundency.
You should be iterating procedurally over whatever you're attempting to do here.
It's very hard to tell.
Yes, I'm sure.
for(NSString* msg in adminmessages.values)
for(NSString* quote in inlinequotes.values)
Both of these chunks of code starting at loops on lines 169 182 should be removed to a function.
Because your'e doing the same thing in both chunks of code. One with inlinequotes.values and one with adminmessages.values
And you seem to be doing it a lot with each of these objects that contain .values.
Like I said, it was the only piece of source code I looked at. My initial reaction was close to indifference.
Good.
Maybe you'll save us both half an hour of hassle.

If it's good enough for Eric S. Raymond then it's good enough for all of us.
Perl is also great but it should be, like, your 4th or 5th language.
Also, learn to use git and host your projects somewhere.
Somebody pinged me.
Oh, I think agaric has admin rights to gentoomen.
Indeed.
Yeah, I checked the group and agaric/"ciraga" is the owner.
Have you used git before, dre?
It's not difficult. You'll generally find yourself using just 4 or 5 commands.
And you won't find yourself doing anything we can't help you out with.
Documentation: The programmer's enemy!
Also, committing to git (even for small personal projects) is an extremely efficient way to keep a record of your project advancing and a way to supply yourself with all-important roll-backs.
I couldn't live without subversioning. It'd drive me mad.

Surely pastebin does Obj-C?
Gotta love that Python modularity.
I was planning to create an OS X Expose-like method of switching between windows.
Alright, time to start messing about with my X session. bbiab.
'morning, everybody.
Deleted it again, but you might get an update in your news feed.
I was meant to be creating it as a personal repo but I just got up and am apparently not paying enough attention.
Apparently so.
Apparently it's so easy I can do it without even trying.
Well, I'm getting pretty good at hacking on dwm.
I'm going to hack down dwm and switch it to XCB from Xlib.
I got sick of Xlib atoms.
I've already gutted dwm down to < 500 SLOC.
And then started rebuilding.
Added XF86 keysym suppoort.
Removed monocle layout.
Now I'm going to switch it over to XCb.
And then I'm going to gut out the tiling and replace it with my own behaviour.
And by that point there won't be any dwm left.
Yeah. great, isn't it?
The idea is to have a working WM from start to finish rather than having a slowly-more-functional WM as time progresses.
That way I can use it, make notes about niggles etc. as it progresses.
And, most importantly, quality check.
Absolutely.
And by the time I finish this I should have enough experience working with window managers to make something for Wayland.
How's bhottu coming along?
Oh, and you might be interested in something I found the other day.
Python bindings for Xlib.
I don't think it's been used for any big projects yet, but apparently it's pretty much finished.
Sorry, I should have been more specific.
I mean window manager bindings.
Yeah, there's a default set-up to hack on that they provide.
Just gives you a simple border around your active window and allows mouse resizing.
http://pywm.sourceforge.net/
You should check it out. Window manager programmign is fun.
Ahahahahahaha
My girlfriend just text me. She went out with a bunch of our friends who are lesbians last night.
One of our (strictly lesbian) friends got kicked out of the gay bar they went to for getting with a guy in the unisex toilets.
The first time I went there I walked in to the toilets, unzipped my flies and I looked up and there were a bunch of girls standing there.
And I was, like, "Oh, shit, I'm sorry! I'm in the wrong toilets."
And they all laughed at me and called me a "square."
They're all hipster lesbian macfags.
They say things liek that.
Very true.
Many of them are, for lack of a better way to describe it, man haters.
My girlfriend lives with a straight couple and 5 lesbians.
Apparently the drama there is unreal.
Students.
She's a med student. Wants to be a surgeon.
Lives with 2 nurses (the straight couple) and 5 art students (the lesbians).
Also interesting to note that the straight couple both use Windows, my girlfriend uses Linux and the lesbians all use OS X.
It's not just a stereotype, apparently.
Do you have many gay friends, chown?
I'd be interested to know if it's more lesbians than gay men that use OS X.
I know there was a study done by the guys at MIT that said that OS X has a disproportianately large number of gay users (something like 40+ %)
But it didn't differentiate between genders.
And I think it's mostly women.
Well, that seems to agree with my hypothesis.
Man, Macbot's so far from coherent it's not even funny.
Yeah.
For chown: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E8cry6Bgig
Yumyumyum.
Cheerios are goood.
Coding fuel.
I love arch, too.
scrot?
The only reason (I I really mean ONLY) I don't use Arch is a lack of signed packages.
Not bad.
Really? Cool.
brb 2 secs
What's all this, then?
People talking crypto?
Sweet.
I'd join in with that.
I'm invigorated.
Xlib was killing me but I've had a really good mornings' hacking.
Sounds awful.
I still have a couple of laptops that I still use with no built-in wifi.
still still still
Complete chat protocol and terminal client.
Now THAT would be a project and a half.
IRC with crypto and filesharing.
I actually don't think it would be too hard to do.
but you'd have to write a proper protocol rather than just hack away.
No way, you'd want to write it from scratch.
That's very doable.
I have some time later today. If I get a chance I'll read the IRC RFC.
Us C guys could write the server daemon.
But yeah, I still think a complete re-write would be cool beans.
Well, without reading the IRC RFC I can't really comment on whether we should start there or from scratch.
But it would be nice to start with some core principles.
Designing from the ground up to have all communication crypto'd and allow users to pass files amongst themselves would be a great starting point, though.
2 things would be a problem, though.
The first is that to allow inter-client sharing we wouldn't be able to hide IP addresses.
Which leads to the second problem, which is that our initial implementations will probably have security holes.
Yes, but we don't want file traffic going through the server.
So to share files we'd have to have people give up their IPs and ports listening for connections of our protocol's type.
But to be fair, it will just be us using it to start. That means we'll have plenty of time to work on those problems.
yeah.
Server only handing out IPs when a transfer is accepted, for example.
But it would be nice ot allow clients to offer a list of availabel files, for example.
To allow simple sharing just between us.
Just looked up SMODEM.
Yes, something very similar to this.
Encrypted chat and file transfer protocol.
We're just coming out with ideas.
Focus on chat to start with the stated goal of including file transfer when we're ready?
Yes, like that.
And the server could host a private key and share public keys only with members of that group.
It would also be nice if each private group had a server of their own.
Physical.
Wait, I think there may have been a misunderstanding there.
I don't mean separate server daemons if that's what you mean.
But that each group would have one member hosting the server.
Hence, we would all have a server that we all used and only trusted people would be given the server's public key.
And then someone else could start their own server and share their key only with trusted people.
i.e. distributed with low inter-connectivity.
A chat and file transfer protocol designed specifically for small groups of trusted users.
Except you're not transferring files to and from the server.
Only using the server to relay chat.
OK, I could work with that.
And to register a channel you have to upload a key to use.
And then to have people join you have to share with them a public key.
If this doesn't already exist, that is.
ah, two-way keying.
Yes.
Already got it up.
(That's what she said)
I just posted the channel on /g/.
http://boards.4chan.org/g/res/15494006#15494669
OP says he would liek to learn C but that books that he finds tell him he should have some programming knowledge before he starts.
Which sounds about right.
I don't know if he'll turn up, though. Not sure if he seems tech-literate enough to IRC.
I actually had to get my K&R C out this morning while I was hacking on dwm.
It was early and I couldn't remember some basic error handling.
Essential.
About £20.
Glorious, chown.

What's yoru IDE, manhose?
I'd like to get ahold of a hardcopy of SICP.
Never even looked for one. Wonder how much they are.
Lordy.
I'm afraid we can't be friends any more.
How much did you pay for it, curmet?
Didn't even know they did a hardcover version.
I just looked it up. £30 for the softcover and £50 for the hardcover.
It's on my wishlist.
Which is public, in acase anybody wants to buy it for me.
Hah.
They don't even teach it at MIT any more, do they?
FFFFUUUUU-
Python is fine.
I thought MIT would have more sense than to teach their dudes Java.
Architecture.
Like x86 or x86_64
You don't know SHIT unless you've programmed an 8-bit RISC PIC10 in assembly.
256 bytes of memory.
Hahaha
16 bytes of memory?
Or did you use long registers?
brb 2 secs
Are you deving it on a live server?
i.e. can we look at it?
I'm going to be dcing pretty regularly while I continue to work on this WM.
Yeah, I got it.
I saved a picture of a bunch of girls in football kits with their arses showing.
Dohoho.
expanded a single-line unbraced if statement to 2 LOC and forgot to bring in the braces.
Silly Johnson.
What's everybody else up to?
dd?
If the drive you want to copy to at least as big as the original?
is*
Well...
Do you mind overwriting that stuff?
Of you can create an iso.
Do you have enough available free space?
Alright.
Well, you won't be able to use the stuff on your c:\ for Windows while it's in iso form.
Is that fine for you?
You'll still be able to mount it under Linux and have access to your stuff, but you won't be able to use it for booting Windows until you write it back to a drive properly.
OK, easy peasy.
From within Linux (either a LiveCD or an installed OS) you can just use dd.
That's one of its many extremely useful functions.
It would more accurately be a disk image, but everyone knows what an "iso" is.
Which is most modern ones.
Man, I'm on fire today.
Getting through my TODO list at an alarming rate.
Pen & Paper.
Yeah, totally.
I'd cuddle her like you wouldn't believe.
First post is funny as fuck, too.
Later, dude.
Hah.
Take a break from it and do something else?
What's up with the imageboard anyway, Manhose?
As in... where's the motivation for this come from?
Hrm?
newstring = oldstring[0:5]
Oh yes, I think it's inclusive.
Are you still adamant you're using a minimum of regexes in botthu, agaric?
ACTION raises his hand.
I think chown wanted to use regexes as little as possible?
Wow. I'm not going to interrupt beyond this but I think you're way overcomplicating this, Manhose.
Hrm. that seems inefficient.
I could write a better function than that.
Well, actually, having said that.
Half of it's dealing with special cases.
So perhaps not.
\033[1m
?
Would do it for a term.
What's the irc code for bold?
print "This is \x02bold\x02."
np
I filter out bold anyway, but I assume that worked?
ACTION puts on his poker face.
It's so much harder for Windows users to get started.
Nothin. I'm just idling about and browsing /g/.
More "I want to learn to program" threads.
Python is pretty. <3
I don't mind the forced indentation overly.
It's much, much, MUCH prettier than Perl.
Perl is and probably always will be my favourit hackjob language.
I used to have no inclination whatsoever to learn Python until I read the Eric S. Raymond article.
I'd just read The Cathedral and the Bazaar.
Nononono.
Coding style isn't personal. Pick a style and stick to it.
Hah.
Most of the preference in coding style is brace placement and var names.
You can still have your precious var name arguments.
%s/\ {4}/\t/g
%s/\t/\ {4}/g
But yes, I was plesantly surprised by Python.
One thing I *will* say against Python, however.
Can't autoformat your code.
Yup.
I really do like Python and I know there's a lot of hate about the significant whitespace...
I honestly think it would be a better language with braces.
Pros of the style: Nice looking. Easy for learning. Cons: No auto-formatting.
That pretty much sums it up for me.
Personal coding style *IS* dumb.
I *WISH* I could force everyone to use K&R C style.
Wrong place, apparently.
I'm working on 2 WMs, dre.
My favourite project right now (and top of my "I have to waste some time with this" list) is LOLCODE.
I found it goddamned HILARIOUS.
And yes, I could imagine it's possible to code in C with it entirely through #defines.
What is going on over here, now?
I had a pizza.
And now I'm going to have a beer.
And then I'm going to go back to coding.
It's Friday!
Huzzahhh.
Sucks to be you.
My friend came back from Germany the other day.
And he says they do this thing with cola there.
It's like a shandy but they use cola instead of lemonade.
Yeah, I'm just outside of London.
Shandy is half beer and half lemonade.
I tried it and it was horrible.
But I think I might drink half of this and top it up with cola.
Party hard.
ACTION cheers
/g/'s particularly shitty today.
I might go re-read Dune.
TV movies?
I've seen the original big-budget movie but I wasn't aware they made more.
I might have to look into them...
I liked the movie as a kid but when I got older and read the book for myself it made me realise that they kludged it a bit.
Right, time to get downloading.
HUZZAH
Now they just need to make the Homeland trilogy into a movie.
Or do something decent with Dragonlance.
Yes.
As far as I know puppy's always had ntfs-3g
Why do I have the funny feeling you're gonna end up trashing something? XD
Hrm.
Chinese food or Domino's for dinner?
Yup.
It's Friday. I can be unhealthy on Friday.

I also lucked out and I live around the corner from a giant trade hardware shop.
Hahaha
Would have been even better if they'd have done "Abort, Retry, Fail."
Still top-tier reference, though.
Complicated but they have fucking EVERYTHING.
Sure, if you're just looking for a 60mW LED.
Doesn't the Launchpad come with 2 LEDs anyway?
lol
But yes, that's a standard red LED.
Croc clips?
Or use a board.
Yup.
never done it, but I don't see where there would be a complication.
Yeah, that's exactly what I would have done.
Notice that you totally don't need the board at all, though.
I'd have just soldered the wires into the the signal rows and banded them together.
But can you see what he's doing in the pic, though?
All that's doing is converting the first ~20 rows of the breadboard into connectors for the signals.
See, that's beautifully done.
Liek I said, I'd have just soldered underneath the board, labelled the wires on the far end and cable-tied them together.
Not exactly messy but this is a really nice, clean way of matching your launchpad up to a breadboard.
But yeah. Have you ever used a breadboard before? Do you know how they work?
The second one is super clean.
the first one is nice but has that unnecessary board.
How many pins are there on the microcontrollers you're working with?
Yeah, you can totally do this with a 14pin.
I assume the Launchpad came with a fairly comprehensive datasheet?
I might have to get a Launchpad... They're just so cheap and they look super easy to use.
Hey, sweet, and then we could share header files for hardware.
I'm not sure if you do the same but when I work I like to define the memory map and processor register in header files.
Goddamn luxury.
hah.
Oh, did you do that thing people were doing and ordering them with a coupon code?
bastard. I missed out on that because I was away visiting my bullshit girlfriend.
Girlfriends come and go but free hardware offers are a rare thing.
Hah.
And no, I get along fine with my girlfriend. I'm just resentful because I wanted free EZ430s.
>girls
>programming and electronics

Well, sounds like you have someone to share your Launchpad experiences with Manhose.
Hah.
Yeah, I'm going to pick one up.
How long before you got yours?
Goddamn.
Catch you soon, man.
Before you go
Just be careful that when you dd you don't put of=/dev/anything.
Sweet. This thing's going to be a dream to dev on.
Right, I'm off to get Chinese food. I'll catch you after you've finished trashing your system, Manhose.
And I'll catch everybody else shortly before that.
beta as fuck.
5 things not to say in a gay bar: 1) Well fuck me 2) Bottoms up 3) Can I bum a fag? 4) Toss you for the next round
And my personal favourite
5) Can someone push my stool in?
Man, that evolution of a Python programmer's great.
Enterprise Programmer cracked me up.
As did "Windows programmer."
I like Perl.
If you're copying with pcmanfm you're not creating a disk image.
That will work fine, too.
When I initially suggested it I thought you were wanting ot maintain your Windows shiz.
If you tried to copy the contents back to a drive and boot Windows from it later it would totally flid out.
But if you don't need to do that you'll be fine.
Yes, dd invoked as
ff if=/dev/sdx of=/whetever/file.iso
Will output as a disk image.
But it preserves everything including the contents of unused space.
And you don't need that.
ISO as a standard is literally just a direct binary copy of an optical disk.
No headers or extra shit added. just exactly what's on the disk.
Back in the day, the standard extension to use for an image made from non-optical media was .img or .dmg
I used ot have a bunch of .img files of Leisure Suit Larry 1 & 2 on my Atari ST.
First time I even copied a disk.
I'm not sure if Apple use .dmg for something specific.
But when I used an Acorn Electron all disk images were labelled as .dmg and they had no additional headers.
Ah, OK.
There's nothing like a nice, light Linux.
I boot into <100MB of RAM usage.
And that's with a 3200x1080 X server.
Wow. That *IS* tiny.
Yes, via xinit
And my .xinit file takes args.
Well, startx is basically xinit without args.
... as far as I know?
Hah. You should see my .xinit. It's pretty organically grown.

How long has your /home partition survived for?
All of my settings have been persisting for probably about 5 years, now, since my last disk failure.
Right, I'm off to bed.
Catch you later, guys.
'Morning, all.
Oh hey, chown got himself a connection.
Also, I has no monies. </3
Oh, I forgot about Dre.

Yes, dre.
Oh, you needed an escape character in vim.
%s/\t/\ \{4}/g
That's my fault.
I posted the original as it would have been in Perl.
You'll remember that now, though. ;)
HAH
Hrm...
I'm not busy this weekend. I might make a roguelike.
And I might di ot in Obj-C just to piss Tab off.
do it*
Hahaha
Well, you seem to have some experience with Obj-C, Tab. Expect requests for bugfixes.
I read the GNU language manual maybe 2 years ago and it didn't really appeal to me. May as well give it a go some time.
Don't take things so seriously.
I doubt I'll be using GNUStep.
More likely that I'll create something that works with stdio on a tty-shaped terminal.
GNUStep is the GUI widget toolkit, right?
Yeah, I'm just looking over some code other people have written.
I don't need much fancy stuff. I'll pretty much just be working with standard C, just enough of a framework to use stdio and Objective-C objects.
So I guess I will need to pull in some Foundation stuff.
Right, I'm going ot have a bowl of Cheerios and read this crash course In Obj-C I found.
I'm having second thoughts, though. I think I can probably do this without OO and Obj-C is ugly as all hell.
I might use Vala.
Vala sans "references."
Wow. Just found a dandy little lib.
Check out libtcod.
Windows 7?
You said you remembered your last VB program.
Ouch.
Man, ncurses is gettign me downthis afternoon.
Anybody have any experience with ncurses?
This POS won't output to a window when I use prints(mywindow, "Blahblahblah"(;
No error message. The window exists but just stays blank.
*sigh*
It does, although I've tried all mad permutations of individual window refresh and full screen refresh.
HOLY SHIT I JUST DID IT.
How odd. This works:
>mvwprintw("window, coordx, coordy, "Message");
But this does not
>ptintw(window, "Message");
Man, excuse awful typos.
Must be something borked about the output position.
Refreshes were exactly how I did them first time around.
Yes, the idea is that you can have multiple windows.
Yup.
Nothing in particular at the moment. Just looking at the ncurses library and hoping for some inspiration.
Maybe a simple procedurally-generated game.
I did consider that.
It would be nice to make a small game.
That's the kind of project people would get involved with, too.
Ah, I GOT it.
Ncurses seems to require you to call a refresh() before you make any windows.
Without it, none of the window you create are... parented to stdscr?
I think.
And apparently you need to do that once before you create any windows of your own.
es, we're on the same tut page.
But I can tell you right now that if you don't do initscr(), refresh(), mywindow = newwin(blahblah), wrefresh(mywindow)
in that order
Your sub windows won't display.
Can't miss that first refresh()
Which seems kind of counter-intuitive but meh.
I guess once you know it you know it.
Honestly? I don't think I like it much.
But perhaps spending 30 minuets trying to uncover that little niggle has jaded me.
Yes, we get the pun.
Nothing more annoying that getting stuck on some dumb little contrivance when you're trying ot learn something.
Right, looks like I'm finally getting somewhere.
Why are people still using damn ugly userstyles for 4chan?
When the 4chan userstyle has already been perfected?
Oh fucking BURN.
Apparently my girlfriend's brother signed up to a computer games programming course.
£5,000.
Total fucking scam. Lost all of his money.
I'll ask.
Apparently they're called "Train To Game."
Train2Game
Fucker.
I just looked at the website.
They look pretty legit to me. I'd fall for it.
My girlfriend just told me that her brother signed up to something called Train2game.
Apparently he put £5,000 down on a sopt with them to get some worthless-sounding qualification.
spot*
Yeah, I think I've unravelled the story now.
I don't think it's a full blown scam but I think her family realised it wasn't worth it too late and the company's refusing to refunt the money.
250GB takes longer to transfer than you might think, eh?
How far through are you?
Are you using cp -n ?
No overwrite.
i.e. you've written the same stuff every time.
So you've been restarting right from the beginning each time you restart your ocmputer.
inb4 rage
I think the flags you want to use are
cp -rvn <source> <destination>
Sounds like it's abhorrantly anti-K.I.S.S.
better to work a way wherein you could simply match 2 patterns against a string seperately.
No, agaric. XD
But if you're able to engineer a way to do that instead it would be a hell of a lot simpler.
>dropbox
Seriously, though. I'd rather carry a flash drive aroudn with me than use a hostign service.
that's fair enough. I don't have to share shit with other people.

Hey, cool shit on the bot.
Tracking repos is fucking handy.
Hrm.
Need a way of creating unique filenames.
Was thinking md5 but I'd rather do something that is part of libc.
I actually did the same thing.
srand(time(NULL));
The only thing is that if I wanted to write several files within a second they would overwrite each other.
md5 turned out to be the least simply way of dealing with it.
I just did a check to see if the file existed and ++filename if it did.

You know what Debian needs?
The Debian dev team is the best there is.
They need to build in an automated way to pull in packages from stable/testing/unstable on the same system.
You can use any DE you want.
As things currently stand you can pull in testing/unstable packages but you often get told your deps aren't new enough.
So you have to download testing/unstable source, build, make a .deb and install manually with dpkg.
But it's the same process every time. Why not build that into the package manager?
Yes, they'd need to implement that first.
I mean... sources are all available.
Hell, apparently aptitude doesn't even support downloading sources.
You have to use apt-get.
But that's why you would build from source if you bring in testing/unstable packages.
The linker will take care of any troubles.
Sure.
But it would be nice to have it automated.
brb
Word up.
Yes.
It's a german thing my friend brought back with him.
And it's growing on me.
I try and say "Beer and cola" to avoid the obvious confusion.
Or, perhaps, Beer/Cola.
Beer+Cola
So you liked it? I hated the first one I had.
But we were sitting in the pub talking about it and the rounds system started off.
And next thing I knew every round was Beer+Cola.
It's gotta be pisswater lager.
If the beer has any real flavour it'll ruin it.
Yeah, light beer is perfect.
We joked about having cola with Guinness.
Or Hobgoblin.
You can't sit back with your pals and enjoy a shot, agaric.
Sounds awful.
But, then, so did cola_beer.
I get the feeling you're a Desperado drinker.
Uh-huh.
Ever have one?
It's pretty much an alcopop but it's just real-deal enough to call itself beer+tequila.
They sell them 3 for #5 at a bar in the next town over.
Full of uni skets.
Oh, I'm on an American setup keyboard at the moment. that was supposed to be a pound sign.
I gave in to the greed and am installing Gentoo again.
Talking from the tty whilst xorg compiles.
How do you feel about stout?
A nice Guinness or something.
Where abouts are you, agaric?
So. Janitors.
I know everyone and their aunt Edna applied but I don't think it really matters who ends up with the role.
I'm just happy we're going to have people clearing the shit off of /g/.
Perhaps not.
But it would be nice if they did add more.
There are still tons of bullshit lolicon or NSFW threads that seem to go on forever.
Agreed.
So janitors can just take them down if it's something stupid.
which is sort of the community way of dealing with them.
Yup.
People who are barely tech literate but seen as geeks and computer wizards by Joe Average.
Hrm?
Whip it out and waggle it at them.
Hah.
It wouldn't be any worse than any of the other shit I see on /g/.
>/g/ I talked to a girl like a goddamn retard. Did I mess up my chances?
Hahaha.
People on /g/ are so hopeless. If I wasn't so aware of how dumb-shit retarded that are It'd make me feel good about myself.
they* it'd*
whatever.
Yay, only 31 builds left and all my basic shit is good to go.
I like Gentoo.
It's just a nice way of having control of your system.
2 favourite distros gogogo.
Gentoo and Debian.
Oh, and also I was going to install Debian but the stable release I had didn't have kernel support for ext4(!)
Which my /home folder is.
Yes, I ran Gentoo for 2 years.
Well, the plan was to run stable and then build for myself the packages that I wanted newer.
And Debian did this nice thing where it trashed my OS dir before telling me it couldn't mount my /home dir.
And then I pretty much had to pick an OS to install.
OS partition*
So fuck it. I'll go back to Gentoo.
Gentoo's the only distro that's 100% totally never let me down.
Oh, also Arch. but >no package signing.
I can't remember what the colour code is for green.
5green?
4green.
3Ah, 3.
3Green.
Oh, also Arch. but 3>no package signing.
I like FreeBSD.
Ports are a big part of why I like it.
And a big part of why I like Gentoo.
I like Ubuntu. It's handy to have all the non-free stuff with Debian.
And people say Ubuntu's gone @down-hill@ -- I presume you're referring to the default setup?
So just do a server install.
And switch kernels.
There was a trend of people advocating the server install on /g/ a while back.
And they were all using the ubuntu-server kernel...
First thing I do when I install a minimal OS (that's every time) the first thing I do is set it up like a server anyway.
Do all my shit over SSH.
I never throw my old computers away.
Especially laptops.
I think I mentioned about my friend's funeral.
Did I mention that I'm going to be playing the guitar?
His mum wants to sing @Wish You Were Here@ and she asked me to play.
Uh-huh.
Scary as shit though, right?
Totally don't want to mess that up.
I grabbed a locking strap the other day so I don't drop my guitar or any shit half way through.
Yeah, I play all the time.
Nothing like this, though.
Pubs and open mic nights and the odd party.
Absolutely.
Every summer people camp out over some nearby fields pretty much every weekend.
And we all drink and have a great time and I play the guitar.
And this guy was one of the other people who'd be there every night. Big personality. The kind of person everybody's friends with.
Midnight sun? Cool.
I might try and arrange a trip to Finland for a camp out in the summer, then.
We do lots of trips into Europe, too.
Lots of my friends are teachers and get the whole summer off.

The parent process waits until the system call is finished.
I believe.
Yeah, they should both exit.
I think you want fork();
It *IS*?
But yes, system() is not what you want.
Yes, you don't want fork() either.
Just flipping through my reference of process functions.
Possibly execl.
Nonono. Why have an intermediate like that?
But you *WANT* to replace the old bhottu with the new, right?
So if bhottu downloads the update and then calls execl("/path/to/bhottu");
Then fork.
Or whatever is good to use in Python to fork. now.
Or, better yet, use your "time to quit" variable to tell your program to quit AND then execl right at the very end.
Ah, I see what you mean.
No way...
The Python devs surely wouldn't use such a platform-specific and inefficient method...
The C standard library exists for a reason -- to do all the things you would do with system() in a lightweight and platform-independent way.
Why wouldn't they just use the stdlib.h popen() ?
/
Seems very odd to abstract C's (very good) method of process management...
Sure, it takes a little while to learn but it WORKS very well.
Unless it's functional programming.
In which case, bring on the Haskell.
OO has it's place.
I, conversely, feel like I'm getting shit done very quickly with Python.
But I feel like I get shit done RIGHT with C.
Same for me and my brief fling with C# back in '05.
I was having problems with Debian and went back to XP.
And C# 2.0 had just been released. Thought I'd give it a go.
Agreed.
Which is one thing I always think when I see someone saying they're learning Java at school and need help.
I'm just, like, "You'll never be any good at Java because you're not self-motivated to learn."
You remember what you use often. That's just the way of things.
Sure it does.
But it also has a whole bunch of bolted-on blobs that you can't hack on.
Like my personal favourite, the window manager.
Sure, albeit by closing off your access to all of Apple's software.
The discussion (for me at least) was on the nature of greed.
But you know how 4chan is.
Sure, it does. FOSS is strongly linked with GNU/Linux and FOSS breaks that greed chain.
Again, yes it is. Windows on OS X don't allow you that important freedom of being able to view the code of every piece of your system.
The best way to learn is to take something that works *almost* how you like and make some small changes.
Yes, but what about when you want to become a kernel developer?
Yes, but it is an example.
I wish I could remember the name of the marketing technique.
Which boils down to reliance.
The reason Microsoft are so happy that schools teach children with Microsoft Office.
Ahhhh. Vendor lock-in.
Go read the wiki article on it.
And stop being so defensive.
What's there to explain? Apple uses vendor lock-in to get you using their software and the software is non-free, which means that a budding programmer can't learn from it.
Although I will say that I much prefer OS X to Windows.
Which is what I do. In fact, I go the whole hog and use the Linux kernel.
I just got a score of 400 on that swf thing.

Ahhh.
Not just a reply macro.

Oh, np. So how did you do it?
Right, that's *much* better.
'morning, all.
I play a lot of poker.
Weighted analysis?
So, for example, if you have an array and each item in the array has a "weighted" size.
Add all of the numbers up to get a total, call a (rand() % total) and step over the array items by their weighted size.
That would give you random selection by most common weighting, anyway.
To invert that you could invert the weighting against the highest weight or some arbitrary number.
What, the inversion?
Easy, although it will need tweaking depending upon how heavy you want the weighing.
Oh... what do you want, then?
So what's the highest frequency you have?
OK, lets' say it's 100, anyway, for the purpose of example.
for (i = 0; i < LENGTH(freq); ++i) freq[i] = 100 - freq[i];
Your frequencies are now inverted.
So use the highest number in your freq array.
5 10 and 15 would become 0 5 and 10.
You can if that's the behaviour you want.
OH DEAR.

Oh hey, great news.
It's a fiddily little problem. How did you deal with the processing?
Oh, wait... 67...
67 is easy.
What was the one that was bothering me? 62?
I actually think I created the code for 67 as fast as I could type.
But, then, different people struggle with different problems.
http://pastebin.com/mPGZmrCv
That was my code.
Ignore the title.
Which language did you use?
Ah, same.
Seemed an easy hack in Perl to load the text file.
Would probably be really clean and easy to do in C now that I look at the code again, though.
Egads.
I don't think I could have done it if I hadn't spotted the hack back in problem 18.
Ah, excellent choice.
I hate the problems where they don't give you a miniature version to solve.
I normally try and solve the harder ones with iterative algo improvements.
The Google search has been added to my list of "READ THESE" bookmarks.
I need to be far more scholarly with these things. I have a tendency only to look things up when I need them.
Hrm. It wouldn't be too hard to implement this in C.
I have a funny feeling it would scale badly to depths such as in problem 67, though.
For the purposes of that problem, anyway. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of situations (that I can't think of) where working with the whole thing as a tree would be good.
Anyway, bed time.

Shush, Macbot.
Hah.
Don't tell me that was you.
I do love that pasta.
Been ages since I saw it. I was rummaging through my "Notes" folder and it was just sitting there begging to be posted.
Timestamp on the file is October '09.
And there are some later revisions. The one I posted was the most recent version from only a few months back.
Let me know if you post any. I love the way it can evolve as peopel repost.
Or maybe it's better if I just stumble across them.
Ah, good one.
I like that.
I think I did see this.
It has potential.
I'm just about to go to bed, but definitely C.
It'll take you 2 days to learn everything you need to know and you'll know all the nice lowish-level stuff that makes for a good programmer.
Anyway, I'm off to bed. good luck with your new project.
I'd get involved in that.
Yes, it is.
Check out perlwm.
Seriously considering bumping up my 2 active WM projects to 3 for the purpose of learning X11::Protocol
Oh yes.
Hash tables. Hash tables everywhere.
I'm also sort of interested in seeing if I can extend one or more WMs with in interpreter of some kind.
Which is almost as good as actually *BEING* cool and not giving a fuck.
I know a lot of people who have died of smoking-related illnesses. I know a lot more that have some serious health problems because of it, too.
Here here.
That depends what you want.
Check out my github for a scraper.
I've also got a program that's the daemon part of what was intended to be a daemon-client browser replacement.
Archives a whole board and allows you to view it locally.
Wanted to add more features like marking posts that have been deleted from the actual boards etc.
Perl scraper and Python archiver, I believe.
Oh, it looks like I never put the archiver up.
Here's the archiver. It was what I used to teach myself Python.
http://ompldr.org/vN2Exeg
I wanted to learn Python properly.
Even parses an rc file.
Yup.
What would your method have been?
So you parse abstracted XML objects instead?
To be honest, the regex parsing lines (41-50) of that archiver script may be the least elegant... but they do rip all of the posts on a page into an object nicely.
Well yes, the XML you work with is abstracted from the HTML.
Which is a layer of abstraction. Probably a very tidy one.
Which makes sense if you're building a fully-fledged framework.
The archiver was designed to be a glorified scraper and split a page into individual posts and sort them by thread.
i.e. ~/.4chan/(Board)/(ThreadNumber)/(PostNumber)
And the post file just contains the post's text content and a number reference to the image posted (which is also saved) if there was one.
To make it easy for someone to write an offline front-end.
Oh and timestamp, poster name, trip etc. etc.
Yeah, I can definitely see that. HTML is extremely lenient.
But yeah, agaric, feel free to fork/re-write the scraper and do whatever you want with the archiver.
I never really expected anybody else to even look at them.
SICPBot spazzing out.
Actually not a bad shout.
4chan toolbox would be a nice idea.
Would be nice to do a bunch of simple image scrapers done in a whole bunch of different languages, too.
Nice for helping people pick up a new language.
Ah, yes. I was going to mention md5.
I think I could probably do us a nice Perl and C dupechecker.
Hrm. Maybe I could do a "crash-course in Linux Window managers" tutorial. Make something out of the hours I wasted reading up on Xlib bindings.
Better way of checking for dupes:
Compare filesize and then, if the filesize is equal, do a proper bit-for-bit comparison.
Yup.
Not gonna lie. that was pretty impressive.
GUI in C? Sounds painful.
Havign said that, SDL is quite nice to work with.
It's no biggie.
Hrm... read up on C89/C99 type qualifiers or hunker down with Stephen King's The Dark Tower series?
Life if full of tough choices.
Hahaha
What's happened?
'morning, all.
It's all yours.
And if anybody wants to improve it they're more than welcome, too.
In fact, when you're done making a fork I'll come along and tidy it up.
Yeah.
Just collect up stuff as a repo for people to actually use and have all the tools they need.
And then just upstream changes and encourage peopel to do the same.
Yeah, exactly.
I could knock one together in 5 minutes.
Let me get some cereal and brush my teeth first, though.
Yup.
Yeah, duplicate functionality in different languages makes for a great learning resource.
Scraper and dupe checker in those 3 languaes seems like a good start.
Maybe a naming convention would be good, too.
Scraper-Perl
Scraper-Bash
Scraper-Python
DuperRemover-Perl
etc.
brb 2 secs.
Current dir.
Yeah, forget checking the thread. I don't see what use that would be.
Unless you wanted ot include it as part of the scraper's functionality to automatically have it remove and images you already have.
OK, so, are you gonna make the repo or should I?
I say box.
Easy stuff.
And when someone comes along who knows D, for example, and wants to help they can.
We should standardise scraper usage, though.
So, like... We can add a README file in the base of the project that describes usage for *ALL* scrapers, *ALL* dupe checkers etc.
Yup.
Tough to co-ordinate, though. It basically means people are restricted in what they can add.
OK, so, how about this as a starting default for the scraper:
Last argument is the URL to scrape from. Repeats the scrape every 10 seconds until stopped. Doesn't overwrite files that already exist. -o flag can be used to determine output dir else current dir is used?
How do you guys feel about those as defaults?
Alright, I'm going to change the Perl script to strict and implement those defaults.
Turns out I only needed to add "use strict;" and change one line.
Yeah, we should specify the syntax as Scraper-Lang <flags> <url>
I was going to mention long/short options. I'm fine with that.
-o --output, -s --silent
I guess I should probably comment this shit if other people are going ot be reading it, too.
4 print lines in the perl one.
One confirmation when the HTML is grabbed
One notification if an image is being skipped because it already exists. One "Getting <image>" and one sleep notification if the loop took less than the designated 10 seconds.
Non-scrolling?
Ah. Not a bad idea.
Maybe we should do scrolling by default, though?
But yes, looks like we have out 3rd flag.
our*
But yeah. Lets just get these damn things up and generally working along the lines of our defaults and then we can make them really nice and polished.
I think I just need to add -o -s and no-scrolling options to the perl script (-n ?)
Ah, this solves a problem for us.
No, wait...
I think it should be verbose by default.
I was going to say that if we didn't make it verbose by default we could effectively sidestep the standardising of output.
Catch you soon, agaric.
I actually really quite like programming in Python.
Just converting my Perl script to Python and it's nothing short od a damned pleasure.
Take that as a yes.
I really quite like the Python version, actually.
Yup.
Seemed like the sensible thing to do.
Needs args just like the Perl one still does but it works quite nicely.
Doesn't search only return one result?
Yup. And then we can get on to standardising and perhaps throwing in a bunch of comments.
-q --quiet is fairly standard for no output.
-o --output if you want to define the output dir
That should be an adequate start.
-q --quiet is fairly standard for no STDOUT*.
I guess the idea would be to be verbose by default.
-l --looptime ?
And -h --help shoudl output a standard helptext that shows all this.
Dat syntax
So you're having trouble parsing "--" ?
In his defense, ObjC is ugly as all hell.
OK, I've added help, quiet, output and refresh to the Python version.
Not to add their functionality.
And we should probably come to a consensus on the string to be outputted as the usage/help text. But I guess that's a "whoever writes it first" thing.
Now*
Yup.
If the GPLv3 fine with everybody?
May as well.
We all support FOSS here, right? May as well just slap a boiler-plate license into the help text.
I don't mind. Either seem fine to me.
w
Oops. Wrong window.
Or -r --refresh-rate
Yeah, that one.
-t --timer
-i --interval seems like the best one so far
OK, just let me finish tidying up the new args and I'll copy it across.
My output dir is giving me troubles, too.
Need to finish this arg handling and add proper interrupt handling, too.
And then this shiz is pretty much done.
That's fine. 5 minute updates are adequate.
Yeah, sure.
Alright, I'm done with the basic flags. Just need to check that the -o dir is a valid path and then the Python2 scraper should be pretty damned well-rounded.
Oh, I still need to implement verbosity...
Hrm. Anybody know how to make self-defined functions work without parenthesis?
I wrote a wrapper function for print.
That only prints if verbose=True
v_print requires me to wrap its args in parenthesis but print did not.
Hah.
Nope.
With my abstracted print function adding non-scrolling as an option would be easy.
But again, I think it's somethign we should add when everythign else is done.
We should try and standardise out interrupt output as well.
I'll copy from the bash script.
Yup.
Just need to add an interrupt signal handler and I think I'm done.
Yup. :D
Alright, all done.
I think I just earned a coffee.
I might write an IRC client at some point.
Seems liek fun.
I was thinking Python, actually.
This shit's really growing on me.
I was thinking about starting a 4chan thread but I really don't know what to write.
Well, maybe that is a project we could work on together, imMute.
And I will, agaric.

I like standard argv argc parsing.
Hey, chown.
I don't think it really matters if the individual implementations progress slowly. The project's not going anywhere.
HAD to? Short options.
Somebody could always come along later and add a clever way to include long options. ;)
Part of the fun is not having to do everything yourself, after all.
Kind of want to see this scraper made in Java and C# just because I hate it.
New project.
https://github.com/gentoomen/4chantolbox
Hah.
I did that LAST.
Ah, somebody posted in the thread...
I don't think it's possible to write this in Brainfuck.
But it would be great to have brainfuck and LOLCODE implementations.
I was just thinking that.
Workign without a regex alone would be daunting.
Why not?
-r 0 would be no wait between attempts.
It wouldn't be difficult to do a --once option.
Need a better flag, though.
hahaha
Congratulations.

Yeah, it doesn't bother me. 20 messages of jibberish is nothing compared to watching you guys talk all afternoon.
D
I don't see why not, Tab. Better too much documentation than not enough.
You haven't broken anything?
I was planning on shoving a TODO into the Perl folder, actually, to note missing functionality.
Oh, nothing too bad, Chown.
Put F and C in single quotes.
That's the first thing I noticed.
You've got a big pile of warnings to work through, though.
Hang on, you've got other problems, too.
OK, so, instead of scanf you want to be using getchar to get a single character.
So use something like "char c" at line 5 to make space for a single character.
And then change line 10 to "c = getchar(); "
I've only got, like, 15 minutes before I have to go. Want me to do you a fixed version of your code, chown?
Something ludicrously high here.
Here's my quick fix, chown: http://pastebin.com/fzqAkcL7
I think your logic's wrong inside the if/else if but the syntax is fixed.
Later, dude.
I believe either line 21 is wrong.
Should read "far = (cel + 32)*1.8, perhaps?
But anyway, the syntax is fixed. Logic just needs a quick look at.
You should really read K&R C. I have a funny feeling you're struggling because you don't understand how C strings work.
And other data types.
Which are, like, chapter 2.
Fine by me.
You could double that and it would still fit fine on my smallest mon.

Oh god.
What did he do to it?
This thing looks awful.
Havign said that, the functionality is improved.
Have you looked at it? What are your opinions on merging it? It's actually a new script "Scrapper-Ruby19" with added threading.
Which kind of breaks the purpose of the poject.
Some of this is good stuff.
The v_print fix, for example.
Unfortunately the v_print fix builds on top of the threading.
It'll be as much work to seraparte out what we want as to write it yourself.
They're all good changes. I think the problem is that there's a lack of communication regarding the project's goal and setup.
Cloning the Python script gave a GREAT Python<->Ruby reference.
Which is what we wanted.
Well, as far as I'm concerned the changes are unusable.
No offence to drbawb, who obviously worked hard and improved the script.

This is going to be good.
I'll have a quick look now.
Did you use md5s and filesize comparison?
Well, as much as possible I'll base the Perl & Python versions off of what you've already written.
Yeah, that BASH script looks easy enough to convert.
I'll Pythonise it when I have more time.
I can't see any glaring errors. If I spot anything when I'm translating I'll push changes.
I love Perl, but Python has actually stolen my heart.
Python has nice, tidy regex handling.
What are BASH [[ -z ]] and [[ -d ]] ?
Args?
Gotcha.
Wow. I'm almost done with the dupe checker but it's gotten damned messy towards the end.
Really neat right up until the crunchy-crunchy checking.
Damned efficient, though.
Doesn't chen generate md5s until it has a size match, which is a goddamned lifesaver if you've got a big dir or a dir full of big files.
s/chen/even/
I really think it should.
After I'm done with the Python one I could probably use some help re-Pythonifying it.
Because the last 10 lines or so are un-Pythonlike.
What do you mean?
It would depend on how many dupes you have?
Yes.
So the filtering is size and then md5.
Generating md5s is disk and CPU-intensive.
We shouldn't even be generating md5s unless the files match sizes with another.
Yeah, really REALLY speeds things up.
As in the difference between a .001 second script and a 40 second script.
Well, md5 makes it conclusive.
Seems perfect to me.
No false positives and runs quick as all hell.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Trivial to make that change, though. the important bit is the rest of the structure.
Hang on. I'm just about ot up the current Python script.
Everything's done except the "Do you want to delete duplicate file?" prompt.
The output could probably do with a bit of a tidyup, too.
eyond the structure? Basically nothing.
I tried to write over the top of the BASH script as much as possible but it wasn't very Python-ish.
Alright, the 99% done version is up.
Check it out. I'm just going to add the deletion prompt and it's working.

I'm not even going ot look at it.
I have bad feelings.
Oh lordy.
Bah. Tutorials are for wimps anyway.
I learnt from well-commented code and api docs and it'll make a man out of you.
Might want to pull a more recent version.
What did you change?
That was fixed about 10 minutes ago.
Bleeding edge much?
Pass a dir as an arg if you want otherwise it defaults to the current dir.
Man, this thing's so close to perfect it hurts.
Soooooon.

I'm up £130 on games of killer and £60 on superbowl bets.
And I drank a lot, which means it's better than a days work.
Yes, I live just outside of London. I think we discussed it.
You mentioned that you were (are?) up North a while back.
Or somebody did, anyway.
Maybe Manhose.
Ah yes, I remember now.

Oh, I don't doubt that he's Finnish.
You know when you arrange to watch movies with someone but it really means sex?

Got a girl that's not my girlfriend coming over to watch a DVD tonight.

Mm-hmm.
Are the girl coming over is one of my friends' exes.
Nah. I think she'll be good and keep a secret.
Hey, DD.

Hah. Oh yeah and manhose as well but don't worry about that. XD
The last commit I can see from tetsuo is the blank README.

It only scrapes /g/
Also, I don't have time to fix it but Scraper-Ruby doesn't work for me at all.
Just shows usage text.
Looks like an error with output dir handling because it works if you add "-o ." as a flag.

My work here is done. I'm needed elsewhere.
Yup.

Hey, guys.
Nah. This is just a one-off deal while I'm on my laptop at my girlfriend's.
Anything but a wiki is foolishness.
github provides a wiki for the group, in fact. Have you looked at that as an option?
Yeah, as much as I haven't contributed to the docs/tuts github's wiki service just makes sense.
Funny syntax on the github wiki if I remember, though.
Not sure if there are other options.
Hey, DukeDerp.
Yeah, an external wiki would be nice if we can have it hosted by a member of the group.
In fact, I think I'd throw my vote in favour of that. Extra control is always good.
I have a home fileserver with 99.9& uptime but an unsuitable connection.
It's more that the connection is usually choked up with torrent traffic when I'm not using it for browsing.
There's a good chance I'll be picking up a VPS next month. If I do I'll be happy to host and give you guys SSH access.
Hosting the wiki on Death's server? I'm game.

Nobody else has added to the 4chan toolbox? :(
I've got a project due on the 18th but I've got probably about a whole week free after that.
Might do something in Haskell.
Probably the dupe checker. Really like that little program.
Thoughts?
I tried to maintain the structure but the move from procedural to OO was a killer.
I have a tendency to write procedurally and then create objects when I'm tidying.
In 2**20-sized chunks.
I believe.
Been a while since I looked at it.
Forgetting full OO, chown, data structures are important in any language.
I'll check it out.
(Feel free to do a fix :P )
In fact, it's definitely not just checking the first 2**20 chunks.
Run it on a folder with 1GB+ files or the same size.
Check the while loop.
It runs forever
But breaks when the read reaches the end of file data.
Updating block-by-block.
md5.update() applies the block's md5 info the the currently accrued info.
Not the fastest but otherwise RAM usage can be a bit... unreasonable.
Yeah, then that's the BASH way.
ThoughtI believe md5sum works block-for block, too.
I can't see the GNU guys writing a program that will load a file of arbitrary size entirely and then hash all in one go.
md5 (declared on line 46) is the object.
It has an update function which is falled as the object "data" (declared on line 48) reads at a rate of 2^20 blocks at a time.
called*
Yes.
And md5 is contained in the fileblock object, which is my own class.
Layers within layers, yo.
f is declared on line 45 and it automagically cleaned up at the end of that function call.
It's just a temporary space to store chunks of the file.
That's a different "f".
Lines 138-140 are just a shorthand way of saying:
if startfile.md5 == "":
.... startfile.get_md5
Yes.
For both startfile and compare file.
So f is just a temporary representation of startfile and comparefile.
Yup.
It's just a shorthand way of doing it.
No redundency.
Perhaps harder to understand if you've not seen it before but great coding practise.
RAM usage.
600 MB of RAM and the function completed in 0.15 seconds or 1 MB of RAM usage and the function completed in 0.16 seconds?
I have a funny feeling CC_MD5 will automatically handle the chunks for you anyway.
I'm sure there are libs out there that will work on a file-at-a-time basis but I don't see what the use would be.
Except for people who need an extremely quick hash and have a shitton of RAM to throw around.
'evening, all.
Word up.
Derp?
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves what?
'Afternoon, everybody.
I've been a bit out of the loop the last few days while I'm away from home. Any news?
Sounds fun. Who's involved?
'evening, motherfuckers.
Ooh?
Checking it.
I mentioned it before but I'm away from home and working on a project -- I'd be happy to help with a small game porject when I'm a bit less occupied, though.
What is this source you linked?
Also, I've been drinking a bit. Apologies for typos.
The original game's?
OK, so... the code you wrote or the code of a clone you want to copy?
I'm thinking the latter.
Who writes in c++ and names their files .cpp and headders .h?
headers*
Good answer.
Well... I guess votes really should go to people who actually intend to work on the project.
I'm happy to abstain until I can actually take an hour or two to look at the existing code base and until I have time to commit to a real project.
You're really going to need someone who can work well with OO data structures before you can even think about making your own game engine, though.
Well, that pretty much cuts your decision making in half.
I'm going to check out the youtube video real quick so I can get an idea of what you're looking at.
Sorry, I'm having real trouble working with this laptop.
OK, I need to grab the original game.
Personal opinion? C ans SDL is the simplest way.
C++ and SDL if you really insist on OO, but for a small project and to teach compiled languages (I know 2 of you are new to C) it's not needed.
My battery's dying. Apologies if I randomly drop.
A little game like this? I just think working it in C would be a great example of using a procedural language and teaching some really simple memory management.
Great introductory stuf and hopefully we'd end up with a fun game to play at the end.
The game looks like it doesn't really need 3d?
I'm literally just looking at youtube videos right now, though, so correct me if I'm wrong.
OK.
SDL is simple to work with and I know the lib pretty well. If we want to scale surfaces and do zooming etc. then we can still easily do that in 2D.
Well, I know I've had my differences with Tab in the past but I think he's probably trying to steer the project in the right direction.
"D
Oops.
Got jogged.
2D and a really simple language is the best way to go.
Especially as the majority of contributors have never worked with a compiled language before.
I'm happy to work with Pygame. Python's really growing on me and I'd like to learn it.
Pygame + Python or SDL + C are the options that obviously stand out to me as viable.
Well, let's be honest -- we don't need to be razor's-edge efficient to make this into a working game.
But working through a really good resource and memory management system in C would make this a nice project.
The game's not going to stress any system regardless of how inefficiently we code it, Manhose.
Even if we're redrawing 10+ screen-sized (abstracted) SDL surfaces every frame at 100+ FPS a modern system won't even notice.
Sorry, Manhose, didn't catch why you were asking.
To summarise why I'm not particularly against a Python implementation.
So yeah... I hate to be the "you guys decide" guy but I don't really mind which we do.
C + SDL seems popular and if I had to cast a vote that's what I'd go for.
Alright. That seems pretty much decided, then.
I picked up another commission today so I'm officially busy from the 18th to the 26th.
But I'm at home from the 20th and can work on the project in my spare time.
I'll be honest -- my major concern is that we'll rapidly move this project from a learning experience for the guys who are new to C to something very difficult to work with for a "learner."
Yeah, I'm happy to pick up the game and have a play to pick it up.
ABsolutely, agaric.
Repost, plz?
Yeah... We need to be happy with the fact that the project won't move as quickly if we're going to be tutoring and getting you (agaric) and chown to move the project along as if myself, Tab and Manhose were just steaming in.
Which is absolutely fine by me.
I know that feeling.
Still, I think you guys underestimate how much it will take for chown and agaric to pick up basic syntax.
Perhaps I'm wrong, of course.
C is *EXTREMELY* simple and nice to learn.
And 5 of us will be better than 3 of us.
OK, added both of those to my fileserver's "to do" list.
Can't do much from my girlfriend's laptop.
Grabbed the Rampart .zip file.
Who are we missing, agaric?
Because the 5 people mentioned so far are (in my eyes) the biggest contributors.
I saw tetsuo42 earlier.
To chat, anyway.
You're welcom to show off your coding skills whenever you want, Manhose. :P
Hahaha ;)
I'm feeling emasculated just thinking about it.
Because it rhymes?

Could do with some artists.
Why am I the muzak guy?
I play a lot of instruments but only for fun. We should be grabbing people from /mu/ that want to do it for a living.
K&R coding style?
Laptop's saying 1% battery and I'm gonna have to walk down the road to grab my charger when it gives out. Just a heads-up.
Battery gave way literally after my 1% message.
I will but not right now.
And I believe you need a static IP for a BNC?
Read the first 20 pages of K&R C, chown.
One of the early examples is how to do that program correctly.
There's also an "answers to the exercises in K&R C" book.
Honestly, chown, there's a bit to learn about the way computers store data and how to control how you program uses data.
But one you have that you're fucking FLYING.
once*
That's how it should be.
It's how computers actually store strings, after all.
When you say 'char* a = "chown likes penis"'
You're actually just declaring a pointer to the location in the stack where the string "chown likes penis" is stored.
With a NULL character to terminate.
Sorry, perhaps I am being a bit too free with the terminology.
But that's why the book is there.
K&R C explains that stuff EXTREMELY well and without a lot of waffle.
And you're building working programs the whole time.
SDL already has good docs and tuts.
Both of you should just settle down for an evening and readi it.
It'll take you a couple of hours to read ~100 pages and it'll put you in a situation where you know enough to code and discuss and learn from experimanting and (most importantly) from what other people are doing.
And remember that we're here to nudge you if you don't get it right away, chown.
I met a guy who wanted to talk to me about PICs today.
Doing his Ph.D in computer science and working with reducing the packet size of cell communications.
And we actually spent a couple of hourse in the S.U. bar talking about the tradeoff between processing power at the device end over a reduced network bandwidth.
Guess which one the telecom providers want?
Bah. Let end-users buy and charge their own phones!
Guy's going to make a lot of money if he can convince the various bodies that his (purely mathematical invention) is patentable and not a discovery.
P.S. it's not.
It takes a lot of political clout to patent something like that.
He'll probably end up selling it for far less than it's worth to a company that cna actually do something with it.
The whole electromagnetic band should be free for personal use.
Everything from 10^-10 to 10^5 should be free.
Particle radiation and weaponised electromagnetic radiation being a different thing alltogether, of course.
Uh... Sure?
I built an FM radio when I was 8.
Still have it somewhere.
Coiled my own electromagnet and everything.
My dad was an engineer. Bought me a kit.
Had to scavenge the parts.
Yeah, some EE and other bits. Picked up patents.
It's why I have money to basically just be a student forveer.
Not far from the truth to be honest.
Never really appreciated it as a kid.
Truth.

I don't mind answering questions about myself.
Got an MEng and studying part time to pick up an MSc in Computer Science.
Brofist for being just old enough that university girls with daddy issues find you attractive.
I don't know what a "neet" is.
Ah, I ask every time and always feel stupid for not knowing.
Study.
Sounds like Computer Engineering.
So just study forever.
Yeah, I understand that.
I come close to making ends meet from various commission-based bits of work but I'd still be making a loss at the end of the day if my family hadn't helped me out.
Still, I'd rather struggle to be the person I want to be than settle for wage slavery.
Gay sex?
On a lighter note, since I cheated on my girlfriend I've gottent this massive, UGLY wart right on my side.
I really hope it's just a normal wart and the doctor can just take it off or whatever.
But unlike chess you can do useful things along the way.
It's more like learning to be a ninja in a world where ninjas can actually cut off your head with a karate chop and run along walls and mad shit like that.
Bah. You can still be ahead of the tech wave.
Mm. Perhaps now more than ever I'm aware that making great purchases and having the best tools doesn't necessarily mean having cutting-edge hardware.
Not sure I agree.
The field is much *RICHER* now.
Tons of great stuff to get involved in.
Especially the free software community.
Ah, shit. I've got to go.
I'll be back around most of the day tomorrow but I won't be able to idle like normal for a few days.
count me in for a little game projcet, though.
And I'll catch you guys soon.

Hey, chown.
I started writing an mpd front-end when I was on the train.
Because I was bored.
C and the standard mpd dev libs.
Just wrote the standard stuff. Was considering using curses but currently it just takes commands from stdin.
And not very well. Wrote it in under an hour with some annoying kids running around next to me.
And I didn't have a net connection (the train company provided WiFi but want you to PAY for it!)
So I was just reading header files to figure bindings.
Hah. Was just thinking that.

Pseudo-code is code written quickly without the standard rigorous error-checking or the expectation for it to work.
The idea is to give an overview of how something needs to be written.
aka redundancy
Always.
Build your tools.
I've not studied it, but it's literally just breaking your shit up into little chunks.
The same as you do every time you write a function.
There's always more.
You hitting the mathematical side hard?
Hah. yes, I do.
Just enough out of your grasp that you realise you don't have some of the assumed knowledge.
Learn or fail, anyway.
I was talking to a guy last week who's doing his CS PhD thesis on phone carrier signals and increased compression. He was using dynamic programming to write his suggested algo.
Scrabble is much harder than it looks.
I wrote a Scrabble "best move" program a couple of years ago.
Just ran through a dictionary checking for available moves and told you the best one.
Thought it was going ot be easy. Nope.
The thing about a scrabble cheating program is that you get better in little baby steps, so it's always good to work on.
I think I just started by grabbing 1-7 letters available and ranking words by the score they would generate.
And then added the board and only included words that would fit.
etc. etc.
Anyway, I have some very boring reading to do regarding Pb restrictions in various parts of the world.

Tripcrunch.
We certainly could, agaric.
Although I'm quite intimate with the code of tripcrunch and I really don't think there's anythign I would change.
Hang on, I think I have a source for the algo to generate trips.
It's in C.
If you don't know C then learn it.
So easy you wouldn't believe it.
Trip generating is super easy.
Especially if you're dealing with the "char" datatype as in C.
Which is essentially just a short.
if ( c < '.' || c > 'z' ) c = '.';
There really is very little need to delve into asm to optimize for this.
mty?
http://ompldr.org/vN2d4eg
I'd probably strip this down and gut out the algo.
Sounds like you wasted a lot of money.
But yes, it would be nice and relatively simple to use CUDA, for example, to generate trips.
Doesn't sound very ready.
Well, I hope you like C.

'morning, everyone.
Drunk and decided to make somethign to eat before I go to bed.
but all I have are potatos and pies so I've been waiting for ages.
And I'm pretty much sobering up.
My girlfriend's a dumb vegetarian nigger.
At least she was until yesterday when she ate a McDonald's cheese burger and apparently is no longer a veggie.
Potatoes take ages to cook.
I wanted to have a kebab and go to bed but I left the pub/club I was in too late and everywhere was closed.
I bought new potatoes because peeling is for niggers.
I might go and cut them in half but I'm fairly drunk and I'll probably cut myself.
I like pretty much all food.
new potatoes are fine.
I prefer Maris Piper but I bought Charlotte new potatoes because I knew I was going to be drunk and lazy.
I was right.
Also, roasties == Awesome.
Hey, did I mention I'm actually playing my first festival in September?
Big Bear fest. For my friend that died last month.
"The Fillers," the official Killers tribute band are headligning.
I'm going to introduce myself as the official Fillers tribute band.
I'm on right before them.
Thanks, yapsol. He was a really great guy and died very suddenly and far too young.
~23ish.
Yup. Bacterial meningitis. Braindead within 12 hours of being hospitalised.
I'd pulled an all-nighter the day before and went to bed -- woke up and he was dead.
Unbelievable.
Uh... what's that about lines of numbers?
OK... so what's the problem?
Sounds pretty useless to be honest.
May as well create something with random strings.
The problem with something of such limited utility is that it's either art or a waste of time.
Yes they are, yapsol.
This may seem like a strange question but I notice that I've been hop for a while and I don't remember when the change was made.
Was I afk or something?
Well thankyou, anyway.
I have to look up IRC commands still to this day.
I grepped through my irc logs and I still can't find anything.
Whatever.
My girlfriend's started browsing /g/.
She's been using Linux for ~2-3 months and is really trying very hard to use/understand FOSS and Linux.
Yeah. real-dela woman.
Medical student. Going to be a doctor.
Which country are you in, chown?
Because she knows I spend a lot of time there, yapsol.
Ah, I remember now. Up North, right?
Also, you should be in bed.
She's managed to get on the appropriate track to become a surgeon, yapsol.
Performed her first autopsy in front of a whole bunch of people a few months ago.
Which is actually pretty impressive. Not entirely sure I could cut a dude up in front of a bunch of people no matter how much training I've had.
Sounds awful, chown.
What's your job/education path, chown?
She's pretty much adopted the right idea concerning patent/copyright law.
Good girl. Smart.
I normally go for dumb girls. I generally find that the dumber they are the better chance I have. ;)
Age, chown?
Bahhh. Ages still to go.
I basically hated the educational system when I was 18. Didn't even apply to uni until I was 23-24.
I've had some fairly serious discussions with my girlfriend over schooling.
I don't want my children to go to school, basically.
The school system is optional in the U.K. and I'd very much like to encourage self-motivated learning.
I honestly believe that children are born curious and forced education kills their will to learn.
With some children, anyway.
Tests are the perfect example of education done wrong.
So, what would be you ideal method of educating a child?
Mine is to supply all of the materials I can and encourage a genuine interest in understanding the world around us.
You know one huge thing that I think parents really fail with? Giving the impression to their child that money is more important than the effect you can have on the world and your own happiness.
I know it's just an opinion, but money is such an abstract and uncontrolable thing... and, ultimately, earning it doesn't really further the most important thing the human race has, which is our collective knowledge.
Earn enough to be comfortable and then put the rest into helping humanity as a whole... If you can ever get that far, that is.
Also, apparently, Dawkins has proven that women basically love that kind of mindset.
Not that that is part of my reasoning, of course. Just a handy extra.

The game will need a resource handler.
Resource handler loads data on request. Images used by the game are actually pointers to images held in the resource handler.
Basic game design theory.
You need a seperate handler for it.
As an example: You create a cannonball in the game.
You create your ball (as a class if we're using OO) and your class asks your resource handler for "canonball.png"
Handler loads the image if it's not already loaded and then returns a pointer.
The idea being that it's just a whole lot safer, quicker, tidier and we won't need to hard-code every resource we intent to use to be pre-loaded.
We can also make the handler smart and able to pre-empt what's going to be needed and load shit in the background.
Asynchronously.
It's really not very hard. It just *seems* daunting because you haven't done it before.
I can write something simple in ~100LOC and you'll see what I mean.

mysprite.image = get_image("canonball.png");
Have you guys settled on a language?
OK, that's great.
I have some time later this afternoon. I'll write a resource handler and maybe some really basic stuff just to draw to a blank screen.
For the record, I played Rampart and I didn't really like it.
That's the simplest way, agaric, yes.
But we could also give the resource handler a list of "We're probably going ot need these later" things to load.
Like if we're getting near to the end of a music track, cannonball images and impact noises during the build phase etc. etc.
And they can load quietly and without causing delays in the background.
Because part of the fun is doing it right, Manhose. <3
But yes, I'm happy to take the resource handler to start us.
It'll probably provide ~5 or 6 functions for you guys to call to get all of your resources.
brb
I was just thinking the same thing actually, manhose.
I'm going to bring it up again before we dive in: I don't think Rampart is a great choice for first game.
Gauntlet?
Keyboard movement and mouse to aim?
Top-down shooter, Manhose.
http://cache.kotaku.com/assets/resources/2007/05/gauntlet_ii_screen__4_.jpg
Yes, very much like Cannon Fodder.
Cannon Fodder was a goddamned GREAT game.
But yes, I really think a Gauntlet clone would be great.
Especially if you could make use of the mouse to aim.

I'm just watching to see how well you explain. No pressure.
Catch you soon, Manhose.
Watch your versions.
Python2 will spit out 5(3, ' and ', 'penis')
Python 2.6.6 gives that as output, anyway.
3.1.2 handles it as you expected.
Concatenation.
Engineering is god tier.
Try not to tie yourself to a course that ties you completely down to intangibles like Software Engineering, though.
Why you do this? :(
What you learn will be out of date within 5-10 years of you finishing your course.
Boom.
I'm just dubious of any course that deals heavily with software and little with hardware, Manhose.
I know you're probably taught enough, but I hate specialists.
Especially since 90% of the "specialists" I know are mediocre in their chosen field and poor at everything else.
Well, that's the important thing.
Later, neter.
People approach education with different things in mind. Lots of people want to have a well-paying job.
What's you plan after you finish uni, Manhose?
Job in software dev?
FOSS thinktank sounds great.
Maybe start a foundation.
Absolutely.
I'd also quite like to work closely with the groups who are buying up patents for the FOSS community.
Keeping power in the hands of the individual is probably the most important goal you can have.
Especially now.
You need governments, but those governments need to be transparent and protect the little people.
And yes, you're quite correct -- governments are influenced extremely heavily by corporations. Law is moving in a bad way always.
Derp.
That's exactly what a government is, yapsol. It's almost the definition.
If we're talking democracy, of course.
Look at it this way, Manhose: You can always do another degree.
You'll be fine, I'm sure. Just... be aware that software's future is balancing very precariously right now.
Either all of the control will end up in the hands of corporations (through non-free code shared only between the elite few) or in the hands of individuals (and it will be hard to be paid for information/software).
It's going to be a real battleground.
Yup.
My best way of summing up why I have a problem with purely software-based development: You either have to restrict people to make money or ask for donations.
Donations are nice, but not exactly reliable.
MEng == God tier.

'afternoon, all.
ish.
I think I've achieved desktop satori.
I can manage my tasks as fast as I can decide what I want to work on and where windows should be placed.
I prefer the Zen Buddhist term to Japanese Buddhism.
I've been working with Xlib the last month or 2 in an attempt to create my ultimate window manager.
One window per monitor, quick task switching and complete keyboard control == bliss.
Also 0 pixels wasted and no window decoration.
Debian.
I think "viurtual desktops" are a misnomer when you're literally working with a single window on each monitor.
Except awesome gets itself all hooked on tiling (blegh) and wastes pixels with a bar.
Also bloat.
dwm fork is good, too. Same functionality but with support for tiling.
Approached the problem from 2 different angles.
I only have 2 monitors, too.
Xinerama is the NUTS.
Use my version. It's better.
DWm is written in under 2000 lines of C.
It manages windows without being in the way and doesn't do ANYTHING else.
i.e. it's pretty damned close to perfect.
Bar automatically hides, windows don't display a wasteful border if they're the only visible window, bunch of bug fixes and XF86 key support to name a few things.
The bar only shows while the windows key is held down and floats above your programs.
It's pretty much just to show you which desktops have something active on (for switching between) your current application and the time.
My default binding for that is Win+Tab.
But you can obviously change that.
Oh, big difference between dwm and awesome: You compile in your settings.
Actually it's Super_L
But I just assume that everybody I talk to is a wintard.
Why you link this, manhose?
Suckless have made more than that.
dwm, wmi, wmii at the very least.
I've never used them, to be honest.
Well, that's a lie. I've used wmii a bit but not really.

Except that being a software dev for closed source code isn't the only way to make it in a tech-related field, Manhose.
The world doesn't owe you a living based upon your degree choice, although there are ways.
I'd happily use that model.
And sya that is X amount of money is raised by the software then release times go down.
if*
Although that does feel somewhat like blackmail.
Unfortunately you have to be happy to restrict people to make lots of money. You can't charge peopel for something they can do for themselves, after all.
Subjugating your fellow man is a poor way to make a living.
Any of you guys have DSes? There are 2 really great games that would be worth ripping off.
Influenced by games of yore such as Might & Magic, Bard's Tale etc.
The Dark Spire and Etrian Odyssey.
Yeah, I have an R4 and I just run ROMs on my DS.
Hah. I like Phoenix Wright but it got a bit same-y.
But yeah -- these games seem like a great way to go about making a game with a small team.
Tile-based dungeon crawlers with random encounters.
No real-time stuff to deal with.
They're both by the same company but I don't remember the name.
Either that or a direct clone of something because otherwise we're going to lack direction.
Oh, apparently they made sequels, too.

Yeah, I know MobyGames.
I say we take a few days (I'm busy anyway) and really decide on the best way to go about making a simple game.
Simple to get going is what we want.
We basically need to chose a game engine.
And re-impliment it.
So yes.
We also need something that's extremely low on story.
Because that's not really playing to our strengths.

'Afternoon, everybody.
Do we have a working name for this potential C/SDL project? I'm in the mood to write a resource handler.
OK, well, I'm going to write the handler anyway.
In a bit, anyway.
I've never contributed any code to bhottu, so I wouldn't say so.
Oh, you. Don't be so cryptic.
What part of bhottu did you want me to look at?
Oh, god. What have I let myself in for?
Sounds awfully boring. :S
Memory manager and game sounds much more fun.

Welcome to your new resource handler.
So when you want a new SDL surface you simply call "res_surfget("Filepath");"
An SDL_Surface is any image.
Well, it's actually a struct.
Within a struct.
My surfaceLL struct contains an SDL_Surface, a filename to look it up with (in case anybody requests the surface later rather than loading multiple instances) and a pointer to the next surfLL in a linked list.
Yes.
And the SDL_Surface struct contains an image and the image's height and width.
btw I'm still heavily changing things here.
My logic was a little off for string comparisons.
If you want to see the handler in action, here's a simple little program:
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/Underworld
Get an up-to-date version.
What's line 47 of reshandler.h say?
Do you have the SDL libraries?
SDL_image
sudo aptitude install libsdl-image1.2-dev
I use the SDl image library to create an optimised surface on load.
... really?
I have no segfault here.
 doubt it.
I just changed the default screen size way down in case you're running at less than 1920x1080.
Do a quick pull.
How odd.
Yup.
Are you launching from the command line? Do you have gdb?
gdb underworld
I'll tell you how to use it.
Just run "gdb underworld"
and then "run"
Type "backtrace" into gdb.
blargiamdead
Alright, ctrl-c out of it.
Maybe github has a tarball delay?
Not important, no.
It *sounds* like you're running a broken version from when I was fiddling around.
You can add breakpoints.
"b 43" adds a breakpoint on line 43, for example.
Just clone the repo?
http://ompldr.org/vN2lucw
How strange.
Any other Linux users about?
I don't see the use?
Ah, now *THAT*'s something I could get behind. A roguelike with a CLI and AI.
Just type "explore" and he would go about uncovering parts of the map automatically.
And set logic break points, like "if you see an enemy, halt".
And then you can be all, like "attack rat"
What's your distro, agaric?
Just about to try compiling underworld on my netbook.
Ubuntu 10.10
Bah. Compiles and runs on my netbook.
I'm about 38% good at statistics (+/- 20)
I wonder what the segfault is...
Odd.
I've got bad news for you, though: I think it's your system.
Which is good for me, fo course.
Because it means my code is fine.
w
Oops.
tmux
Requesting screen shot.
Fix your .bashrc.
You've probably tried to use colors in your .bashrc that are only meant for 256 colour terminals.
Stop picking ta it.
It's flashign because you're using my colour setup for your TTY.
Edit your /etc/passwd file.
I used Gentoo for a couple of years.
Whywouldyoudothat.png?
Use Gentoo on a server?
Lack of security updates and computational requirements of compiling from source.
Not if you're runnign your processor at 100% load.
Even daily updates don't mean security patches.
So when are you niggers gonna look at starting your little game project?
Am I right in thinking you're going to do a smaller project as an intro to C before we do the big game?
Also, I wrote a config file parser to go with the resource manager and I'm planning on extending them both.
I honestly think it would be a good idea, though.
Maybe a single little 1-screen puzzle game or something just so you can get used to the syntax and the headers I'm going ot provide.
~12 hours.
With X but without a DE like GNOME or KDE.
Do you have a Gentoo-based system to work from?
You can mount /proc and chroot if you've got teh skillz.
Maybe na hour.
Maybe longer, then.
Also, the first thing you'll want to do is re-emerge yout ool chain.
Compiler, linker etc.
With your use flags and for your arch.
And then compile them again with your good tool chain.
And *THEN* pull your big packages.
Core2Duo with -j3? I think 12 hours is a reasonable estimate to compile all your system libs, Xorg, firefox, etc.
Yes.
Yes.
dwm's a 2 second compile.
Fixed some little bugs. Compiled in XF86 key support.
i.e. your keyboard media keys.
Single windows on a screen don't have a border.
Little things.
The kind of polish I felt dwm was lacking.
Just an error in their VT100 escape sequences.
Yeah, apparently this project's extremely new.
But on their list of integral features is unlimited backbuffer.
I know because I was going to write my own.
So I went to ask the devs about it.
If they're going to impliment it then I'll just wait and keep pulling from the git.
Yeah, I can understand that.
Other than that I'm extremely happy with it.
I'm currently using it, actually, even without a scrollable buffer.
I considered using xterm-256color
But I've not had any problems with it.
I'm actually really shocked that everything's just worked perfectly for me.
Anyway, I've got to head off. Good luck with the Gentoo install.
HAH
Well, if you want to change our naming convention to include filetype extensions then feel free to argue about with whoever will listen.
I think a #! at the beginning of the file is adequate enough, though.
That wasn't directed at you.

Oh, I have an old PB laptop somewhere. Like, really ol.d
And release it under a freedom-facilitating license such as GPL??
So what are you working on, Manhose, and which language?
Oh wait... Java...
3>WINDOWS
3>ANYTHING
I had to do a Java course some years ago.
And that wa sback when Java was still on the FSF's bad side.
I was working for a degree and it was only a small module.
They wouldn't give me my piece of paper unless I did it.
Bleck.
"Folks going into enterprise" are worse than scum.
Except that that's not really being an enterprise programmer in the sens it's used.
When people say "Enterprise programmer" they generally mean the kind-of shit-tier imagionationless work done by somebody creating simple software for greyfaced office workers to use.
Normally using an SQL database and probably capable of loading data from a spreadsheet.
And other boring mundane stuff.
Yup.
XD
But you have more of it.
Bloated water.
Switching up my OS.
And tryign to strip out non-free stuffs.
Pretty much just nvidia's drivers and kernel module left, now.
Damn them.

http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/debian_frees_kernel_again

It's not in your kernel, anyway.
Even little things like b43 kernel modules are absent.
Which is great. Fuck bullshit wireless drivers in a desktop.
sudo aptitude install vrms
Hopefully they're not b43.
You can always install them but it's much nicer to be able to run a free system.
Yeah, it's FOSS.
I like extreme battery life. I travel a lot and my netbook's a godsend.
I'd take the 2nd one.
All black, baby.
Matte black brushed metal is the way forwards.
I hope the screens are non-glossy.
I'd buy one of these if the hardware compatibility was good.
Ugh. Awful placement on the touchpad, though.
I normally disable it anyway.
I like the EEE PC 1005P. I'd have paid a couple of extra pounds ot have it in metal, though.
HAL
udev, then.
It's what HAL's built on top of.
Just a hardware abstraction layer that configures your system for you.
I remember when you used to have to open up your computer and manyally look at addresses to install Linux.
manually*
It would ask the PCI address for your sound card.
Why are you under the impression other people want to use VS?
It's just a bloated text editor with a shitty compiler.
Microsoft fall into the same trap that a lot of companies do when they make non-free software.
they try and amalgamate as many tools into their one piece of software as possible to make some kind of "it's all I need" monster.
c3>Power user
I'm power user level in htop
Use vim or die trying.
Seriously. Every time you learn something new when you're using vim you're like... SHIT THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
Comes in steps.
When you realise d$ deletes until the end of the line or d0 deletes everything to the start of the line.
Never played it.
And then you're all like... dtX deletes everything until the next instance of that character.
Think about it.
Move inside a quoted string.
dt"dT"
Now you're sitting inside a pair of empty quotes ready to replace the string.
dw

Yes, I know the Windows keybindings.
And no, ctrl+shift+arrow I believe moves in single word jumps.
No, it's 2 keystrokes.
dw
No.
That's indert mode.
indert*
inSert*
Insert mode isn't the default.
But yes, you may assume that VS is a similar speed to editing with vim or emacs or even claim that it's faster.
I've used both a considerable amount, though, and I say vim is faster.
Escape exits insert mode.
And you don't have to press enter.
Most people bind capslock to escape so that they can touch-type.
Oh lordy.
Now *THAT* must be painful.
Analysis.
I'm fine with lexical analysis.
It's good enough.

No problem.
OK, so... Super T or Super-Return for terminal?

OK, how's this keylist sound:
Super+Return or Super+t for terminal, Super + i for browser, super + e for nano in a terminal, super + z for htop in a term?

That's default dwm behaviour.
I'm going to be taking that out in the next update and putting in a standard clock.

        sleep 60

And then I just call that function before I launch dwm.
BASH syntax isn't a strong point of mine.
That was recommended to me as a way of doing an infinte loop and it works.
Oh, OK.
Again, I only know enough BASH to get by.
And I learnt it in the mid 90s.
Boom.
x piping removed and datestring added to config file.
Because they secretly want to handle video and other complex data streaming in the future.
Well and therein lies the rub. Choose a more specific program for your needs and you'll be fine.

Best way to read a file into memory EVER?
If you have fixed sized files, anyway, and don't want to handle an overflow gracefully.
To be fair, it really depends upon the situation.
Reading a file into a fixed sized array is pretty much madness.
Having said that, in[] could point to memory on the heap.
Hey.
There have been a few threads on /g/ recently with people really failing hard at C string manipulation and I/O.
There was a guy last night failing hard at simply reading input from a file and just got me to thinking about how I'd do it.
I do it*
Mm... Mid-level with low-level features.
What are you feeling is too abstracted, manhose?
I mean... when you write a program in C you can pretty much work through in your head how it will translate to ASM.
Mm. I don't really consider it to be a problem.
Especially when you factor in function unrolling and other optimisations you can get automatically form a flag to the compiler.
3>mfw your lecturer's a Javafag
Even more reason to hate it.
The difference is that Java has an open and standardised specification.
Microsoft have a clear Embrace, Extend, Extinguish model that they've used countless times before. Best just to use a free alternative.
They also have a specification for a standard set of tools and how code written in those semantics should act.
Microsoft haven't had an ISO/ECMA standardises specirfication since C# 2.0
We're on 4.0, now.

And the fact that it compiles down to C? DREAMBOAT.

That's what I did when I wrote shit in C++.

A string is just a null-terminated array of chars.
Problem, officer?
char string[10] = {'n', 'i', 'g', 'g', 'a', 'r', 'd', 'l', 'y', '\0'};
is the same as
char *string = "niggardly";
* prepends a pointer.
So using our example, "string" here is a pointer. remember that arrays can be treated as pointers.
So when you do a prints, for example, you're giving the printf function a pointer to the memory location of the first character.
And then the function just steps over the characters and prints them until it comes to the null-termination character.

Ubuntu is fine, jeffisaboss. Anybody who says otherwise is an elitist.

BackTrack is based on Ubuntu.
And I don't know what you mean by "restricted terminal" but the answer to that is also no.
You know what would be a really good idea?
A multi-distro source manager.
That handles dependencies, keeps an up-to-date list of package git and mercurial locations and can grab source for you on request.
No tars. using git and mercurial.
The idea is that it would use the distro's own package manager to handle build deps.
And then you could just pick out a handfull of your must-have bleeding edge programs to have handled by your source manager.
Package manager doesn't need to know it's installed.
It just needs to know you want the deps.
make install
Or better yet, leave that up to the user.
Later, jeffisaboss.
Clone a git repo. It'll have some means of installing.
It would effectively just be a list of git and mercurial repos.
"sourceman vim" would literally just run "git clone http://git.wherever.com/vim.git /usr/share/src/vim"
I literally just want a program to know where all the repos are for a simple lookup.
And do a pull on all the ones I have installed automatically.

But it would have been nice to see how she reacted to that quote.
I worry about you, DukeDerpie.
Ish.
<3
A great first example is a XOR encryption, DukeDerpie.
Do you know C?
XOr is woefully easy to break but I could give you an example.
You can write your own XOR algo. It's easy.
You literally just loop over your "key" or password and XOR each character of the intended file with the current character of the password.
So if your pass word is "Derp" and your file is "Hey, how's it going?"
D XOR H
e XOR e
r XOR y
etc.
Welcome to your first XOR encryption algo.
I never got much into encryption but I got a little further than that.
You've just awakened my interest.
I hope you like bitwise operators.
The good thing about the XOR algo is that to decrypt is the same algo.
The next step from a woefully easy-to-break XOR algo is an impossible-to-break one-time pad.
Which is exactly the same thing except you generate a random password of the same length as the file.
Impossible to break without the pad file.
"Hey, how's it going?" XOR "hjsrvl93(65$jVhh" = 2 files that XOR together to make the original.
I may have gotten the number of characters off, there.
But you get the idea.
And yes, you could make a book the password. There's nothing more secure than a pseudorandom password with some human interaction thrown in to make it REALLY random.
That's pretty much encryption 101 and getting towards the limit of my knowledge.
I wrote programs to do those 2 basic types of encryption back in the day. Let me know if you get any further.
Cryptography seems really fucking fun now that you've brought it up again.
I agree.
And I'd enjoy contributing to that.
Pretty busy at the moment, though, so I can't really spare the time until maybe Wednesday.
But I just know that if you put a simple XOR algo up I'd want to play.
Anyway, brb.
3>10pm on a Friday night
Why aren't you out, nigger?
I have work to do. :(
But I'm in for ab ig night out tomorrow, which will be nice.
Remember you're working with ASCII.
a = 97
l = 108
2 secodns while I work out the binary.
1100001 XOR 1101100
1100001 XOR 1101100 = 0001101
Should make 25?
13*
The trouble is that you need to use an offset for control characters.
I believe the first readable character is 32.
Otherwise you end up with 'a' XOR 'a' == EOF.
Otherwise you end up with 'a' ^= 'a' == EOF.
Tell al ie. == NULL
Well, I guess that will still work. Maybe you don't need the offset.
Are you sure 'a' ^= 'l' == 'k' ?
3>'a' ^ 'l' ==k
Even.
3>'a' ^ 'l' == 'k'
I'll get it right eventually.
What's your program?
No, I'm totally right.
http://ompldr.org/vN2s5ag
Not double quotes!
"l" is the same as {'l', '\0'}
Oh, OK.
Ah.
3>Python
Maybe Python has a layer of abstraction to its characters. In C characters are just saved as short ints.
Hence, the program works like it should.
I wouldn't want to XORing characters in a scripting language. I just wouldn't even feel sure that the interpreter was going to handle it correctly.
If you wnat to use characters that would be friendlier for you to see;
'8' XOR 'l' == 'T'
Tech level: 3

Goign to add the args in in a minutes.
Currently it's one way. Needs about 15 more lines to work in reverse.
Unless you want to do it, of course.
It currently makes a pad from random characters for you.
I just need to add in the logic for reading in a pad file and arg handling.
It's returning a float but stuffing the float into a char space.
To be safe I should cast the type, though.
I also need to seed the rand.
Nononono.
The binary for that float is a random collection of 1s and 0s.
When read as a character it just gets a character.
Imagine the float 0.367536723 is 011010101001010 in binary.
Stuff that into a shirt int and the number is read completely differently.
short int*
Although you are still right; I need a better method of generating random characters.
But check out the Testpad.txt file.
Well yes.
but when you create the pad that file is filled with jibberish.
It's always the same gibberish right now because I haven't seeded the rand.
But it still shows that I'm effectively generating gibberish characters for the pad.
Doing it now.
Even though I should be working.
SUCCESS
Mine works.
http://ompldr.org/vN2thbw
http://pastebin.com/ZSpG67T5
"e" for encrypt. takes in infile and creates an outfile and randomly-generated pad.
"d" for decrypt. Takes an infile and a pad and creates a final file.
I guess I could add an "a" for "apply a pad".
I've got some work to do but when I come back I'm going to compile this with -Wall and really polish it up.
Right...
So I'm no longer XORing exclusively aginst ASCIi characters.
char is a short int
I'm filling the short int entirely with random bits, now.
And I removed the dependency on seeking through the file looking for an EOF as well, but reading in the size of the file.
The EOF character can now be one of the characters in the encrypted file without causing problems.
But yes, I believe a short int/char in modern computers will be at leas t2 bytes in length.
No. Also using unreadable characters.
DukeDerpie is interested in cryptography.
Hang on. Let me show you an updated program./
Admittedly what I've written will only work with full pads.
So you have to use a pad file at least the same size as the file to encrypt.
I'm telling you, man -- it's because there's that extra character-handling layer with higher level languages that cause problems.
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/XORer
You're using Ruby, did you say?
That sets p as a completely random short in/char.
short int*
With a value of 0-65536
If you're using a 32-bit processor.
Stop thinking like that.
A char is just a short int.
And you can XOR it against any other short int.
It's no problem.
Ok, so, lets say your character is 'a'. That's a short value of 97.
The output to a file is binary.
So if the output of your XOR is 11001101 that's just output to the file.
Open it in a text editor and it probably won't show you anything meaningful.
But it's still there.
And your program can still read it.
And still sue it to reverse your encryption.
Grab a hex editor. that's probably the best way to be sure thay your output file is how it should be.
Sorry, I've been busy. reading up.
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/XORer/blob/master/xorer.c
Keep an eye on the source there.
20 % 9 means divide 20 by 9 and get the remainder.
It doesn't work like that any more.
Now I just get completely random bits and shove it in a short.
That varies depending upon your arch.

Oh, and to answer your previous question, chown: I'm using my own window manager that doesn't decorate windows. Hence everything I run takes up 100% screen space.
4chan fucked up the same way this time yesterday, I think.
There are a few reasons I don't use Chromium.
The first is a lack of plugins.
The second is that WebKit has a quirky way of rendering wherein it draws a white screen before an actual page.
As somebody who does his best to avoid 100% white at all times this is a problem for me.
I haven't managed to find anything like Vimperator/Pentadactyl.
And browsing with keyboard alone is important to me.

Not smarter is good.
Nothing better than a girl that doesn't know how hot she is.
As soon as girls can start going to pubs they figure out that they can pretty much do whatever they want.
In some odd piece of social irony girls call all the shots because if they need a guy they can get one.
But they never want to be in control of anything.

Anybody read any Neal Stephenson?
I'm half way through Anathem and I'm thinking about picking up Snow Crash or Neuromancer.
Books, yo.
They're those things made out of wood that people used to read before the internet.
Hah. XD
Anathem's really good.
I heartily recommend it.
Neuromancer is high on my "people keep telling me to read this so I should hurry up and fucking read it" list.
Bunch of monks in a monastery that are locked away for 100 years at a time to contemplate maths and science etc.
Loads of computer science, cryptology, astronomy references.
The monastery has tons of gears and inner working in it. I have a funny feeling it's a big computer.
And I also have a funny feeling the monks are there to drive its chaos engine.
They have their own crops and water.
And people are able to drop off orphans at the gates.
But everything seems a bit... off.
Some of these guys seem to be well over 100 years old.
But yeah... Neal Stephenson's been fairly good at giving a slow trickle of explaination so far. I don't think he's going to be one of those cunts who throws out a bunch of mystery and then never explains anything.
Oh, Cryptonomicon is the other Neal Stephenson book that comes highly recommended.
And a series of books calle The Baroque Cycle.
The only thing that I'll say against him is that reading any of his books is a real commitment.
I don't think he's written anything under 900 pages since Snow Crash.
And I don't know how many books are in The Baroque Cycle but they're ~1000 pages each.

It's because I write extremely long sentences that don't really go anywhere and sort of don't really have any point beyound what was succinctly said within the first few words.
Also, if I make a typo that adds an extra letter in I just leave it because I don't give a fuck.,
These are the secrets to my success.
You know predictive text?
Sometimes I just send whatever comes up as the first word anyway and see if people can figure out what I was saying.

Could be incorrectly configured MTU but I doubt it as that would more likely cause completely dropped connections.

Yup.
Yeah, I'm looking at the same page, I think.
I have a funny feeling I can actually do this without libxml and more efficiently.
3>mfw some nigger called tekkub is getting credit for my work on github.
Nah, it's just that for some reason my commits are showing with his name on github.
But not on the RSS, oddly.
https://github.com/gentoomen.4chantoolbox/tree/master/C
Also, this scraper is fucking RUTHLESSLY efficient.
ey, interactii.
Not bad.
Right. Date night.
My girlfriend's talking to me again so I'm going to stop programming and go see a movie.
Scraper in C is actually amazing.
The neckbeard in me appreciates the efficiency.
It's got plenty of room for optimisation if you decide you want to step in and help out. ;)
I believe in you.
Some of the more badass-ish guys program C.
Right. Date time.
Later, dudes.

Hey, guys.
Why you niggers looking for U.S> niggers?
Niggers.
Since when was the channel +m?
Also, what's up with the PyWeek/U.S. thing?
np
It's not hard to block a bot, though.
Anybody have logs?
3>mfw I go away for a night out and shit goes down
Odd.
Nevermind.
Hey, chown.
I don't think there's anythign wrong with the channel...
A U.S. OP would help.
Absolutely.
Easy enough to do.
Or if we have a fuckton of joins in the space of a very short time automatically +m for 10 minutes or something.
Or allow any voiced person to "SICPBot, flooddefense"
Plenty of ways of dealing with it that don't require massive sweeping reforms and breaking up of the channel into parts etc.
It would kind of defy the original purpose of starting the channel.
C scraper and dupecheckers now 100% working.
Scraper needs some of our agreed-upon functionality added but it's all good.
Niggers.
Bah. As if I actually want to get along with my girlfriend.
I'd never get anything done that way.
How are you?
Fairly standard complaints about Java.
Damn right it is.
Steak and Guinness is the dinner of champions, though.
You just lost 10 man points, Manhose.
Although I guess it's better than being a big fatty.
Oh shit. -10 man points was enough to cost you your upper case letter?
Harsh but fair.
Nope. I'm free for another week before I'll be looking to do any more paid work.
Had a couple of days with my girlfriend and then I'm off to visit some friends.

Hey, agaric.
Glad to see we're -m.
Had someone recently linked us on /g/?
Seems odd that someone would want to spam the channel without having visited it recently.
I'm not following.
I've never even heard of derpcat.
Shows how much I pay attention.
Interesting.
Why would you do that?
Fair point.
Niggers gonna nig.
Also be sure to allow voiced+ users to be exempt from the anti-spam checks.
I'd love to help spam up the channel but I've got shit to do today.

Chilling. Billing.
Not taking on any more projects until at elast the 2nd.

And I'm visiting Kingston University from aroudn the 28th to the 2nd.

You up to anything interesting at the moment?
Every now and then crypto catches my interest.
You done any crypto?
I wrote a XOR/un-XOR program back years ago and recently decided to re-visit it.
Created a one-time-pad implementation.
Are you going to be participating in PyWeek?
Nice. You know the dates?
Oh, i just looked it up. 13 days and 5 hours.
Really? I was underwhelmed by the games on the pyGame site.
But looking at the PyWeek site there seem to be some decent contenders.
I'll be at home when the challenge begins.
As much as I do write on my tiny little netbook I find it a hell of a lot easier to program and concentrate when I'm at home.
It'd be nice to do a really good showing.
Ooh. Pub quiz at 8.
3>mfw last time they had a question about XORing 2 binary numbers.
You know what a pub quiz is, right?
It is what is says on the tin.
You go and have a pint and everybody throws in a pound and forms a team with their friends.
And then they call out a bunch of questions and your team answers them.
And the winning team gets a prize.
In this instance a case of booze.

Hey, neter.
Did you write that, agaric?
I'm actually pretty impressed.
<150 LOC
It also needs to be broken up into functions.
But I'm impressed all the same.
My girlfriend's just asked me to scp it to her.
Hah. My girlfriend's playing it now.
Feedback so far: It should start off a little slower.
Because she's a spastic and can't grab the apples.
3>mfw my girlfriend's still playing snake
Agaric needs to come back so I can thank him for keeping her out of my hair.
Interesting.
Hey, TSwift.
Hey, agaric.
My girlfriend likes the snake game.
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean the game you made. ;)
See what I did there?
No, in all seriousness, she literally sat and played it for like an hour.
Kept her right out of my hair.
I'm getting "return code 22" when I try to push a little fix to the pyweek repo.
Which I'm assuming is a permissions thing seeing as I can push to other projects including the 4chantoolbox.
Not sure why the RSS feed shows the pushes from my netbook to be from me but the commits actually seem to be attributed to tekkub.
it are mystriry
I'm not really about for the rest of the night but I'll check progress in the morning and have a proper look at the code.

I'm interested in doing another cert with them but their system is confusing as shit.
And, to be honest, when I did my CCNA the material was so boring I could hardly pay attention to it.
Nah, it's a pile of shit.
The Cisco Academy site is probably the worst learnign resource of all time.
The fact that it's entierly made in flash should be some indication for you.
Hang on.
I might still have access to Cisco's material at netacad.net
Ah. I can't remember my login.
Oh wait, I got it.
Although I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to show you. It's basically just a full-page FlashBlock blocked Flash object.
Oh, I haven't got access to it anymore anyway.
Boo hoo.

You have one?
Cool. :D
Twist & go or gears?
I only did my A1 because I had my B but didn't want to pay to run a car.
And at the time I wasn't travelling far afield so a 125cc could get me pretty much everywhere I needed to go.

Your maze game just draws a white screen for me.
I would guess it's not playing nice with a resize request.
Yeah, it's not an executable filetype.
brb 2 seconds.
Yeah, the problem seems to be with certain window managers.
Under awesome, dwm and jdwm I get the language selection dialogue and then the maze actually just displayes a white square.
Works under openbox, fluxbox and twm.
np
Also, the exit on the maze didn't seem to work.
I got all the way to the exit of the maze (it was on the right-hand side) and couldn't move any further.
Oh, OK.
How do you kill the dragon?
I just snuck past him.
I thought that was the point.

Hey, ShameOnATrip.
3rd time's the charm.
You always come in and say hey and then disappear before I notice.
Anybody else about?
PyWeek's started and I've got a couple of hours to spare if anybody's interested in working on it.
Hey, wb.
I've got a couple of hours free and I'm in the mood for some coding.
Hey, agaric.
I thought you guys were going to be taking part in PyWeek?
There's a Python game competition that's just started, ShameOnATrip.
Booo!
I was really excited about PyWeek and I'm gutted I'm not really going to be able to contribute.
Yes, I was just looking.
Shitty theme.
I wouldn't mind helping you out, ShameOnATrip.
The only catch is that I'm busy from tomorrow morning until at least the 10th.
It's the reason I'm not involved with PyWeek.
Fucking SUCKS.
At least it's a shitty theme.
I feel less bad about missing out, now.
I'd have been happy to take project lead. Maybe next time.
My girlfriend still plays the version of snake you made, by the way.
I can't even think of a concept for it.
"YASC?"
Yet Another Spacewar Clone?
Hah.
The trouble with Spacewar! is that you need 2 players.
And I pretty much hate doing anything but sex with my girlfriend.
And sometimes snuggles. <3
Sounds kinds cool.
Hah.
My only idea for the theme is still something cat-related.
And probably some mechanic that makes it impossible to finish the game without dieing 8 times.
Celestial bodies in our solar system?
I'd go with the sun + 8 planets.
Well, we could make a joke of it.
8 1/2 planets
9 stages of your game, agaric. One for each planet.
Varying amounts of gravity and maybe some special extras for different stages.
Which actually works really well because the later planets all have rings and tons of moons.
It's up to agaric.
Working out the angle wouldn't be too difficult, agaric.
You mean you don't have gravity in your current version?
URRGGG
I wish I had time to do this properly. I could get the gravity working in 30 minutes ot an hour.
 /exec git pull git/pyweek
Oops.
If we actually do PyWeek at all.
Which is probably the best warning I can give you, ShameOnATrip: This isn't something we're definitely doing.
If you contribute code then there's no reason you shouldn't be able to use this as your project.
So long as your class will take a project that was worked on by people outside of the course.
OK.
Are you working on any of this right now, agaric?
OK, I just made a quick switch-up of colours.
To make it a white ship on black background.
And I'll dump in a star.
That cool?
And then I'll create a function for figuring out position relative to the star/planet.
And then a member function that bends trajectories to simulate gravity.
Yeah, I say we use .pngs.
I only glanced at it.
Also, what command are you using to push?
Art could be handy.
I'm not sure but I don't think I have commit rights to the master branch.
"git push origin master" asks me for a username and pass.
Ahhhh. Now I remember.
Yeah, the code's clear enough.
How about bounding boxes?
i.e. when the ship goes off the screen?
Bounce is easy.
Pseudo-code incoming.
if ship.x < 0 || ship.x > screen_size.w: ship.traj.x = -ship.traj.x
Ah yes, good point.
OK.
I'm having trouble spotting the variable(s) for the ship's trajectory.
Ah
ship.dx and ship.dy?
Ah.
OK, that's cool.
Because it allows us to use a different value of z for gravity of different planets.
I think the angles on the ship should be handled differently.
Or perhaps I'm mis-reading.
But the ship should have a position x, position y, velocity x and velocity y.
Yeah, I think I was just having ab it of trouble picking out that logic.
I see what you're doing. It's cool.
I've just done a bit of tidying. Helps me to understand what you've written better if  do that.
Which is a fine enough way to do it.
Whether it uses the floor value or rounds off doesn't really matter to us.
Right.
Lets get NORMALIZING
Basically all vectors should be floats between -1.0 and 1.0
Because then we can use normalization to work out the vectors between the celestial body and the ship.
Also, would you mind if we made the default game size a little bigger?
Say... 800x600?
Oh, brilliant idea.
If we set Earth's gravity as 1 we can then determine the gravity at the surfaces of other planets according to real numbers.
Or better yet by mass.
OK, have a look at my changes so far and tell me what you think, agaric.
Very aware that I'm working on a project that I might not have time to do much with so I'd rather not mess up a bunch of stuff you were happy with.
So far I've pretty much just added stuff.
Well to be honest, ShameOnATrip, we almost have a game already.
A very bare-minimal game.
That could use tons of extra stuff.
But we literally just need to apply gravity and projectiles.
Need to do collision detection with the planet, too.
Projectiles *ARE* easy.
Oh, wait!
Why are we bouncing when we should be wrapping!?
Literally what it says on the tin. Imports a whole bunch of functions for us to use.
Sounds good.
All cool features we can get in once the game's got a single fully-functional level.
OK, changed the behaviour at the side of the screen.
I say we use bullets like in the original (so that they can be affected by gravity) and give unlimited shots.
We can add fancy stuff in later.
Yeah, lets do that then.
Best to make a direct copy of the original to start with and then make changes to the gameplay later.
Yeah, I saw that actually.
Which is why we should stay true to that and use real physics.
OK, I've got to be up in 5 hours so I can't spend much more time on this tonight.
Hrm.
I added basic collision detection but it might not be right.
And we'll obviously have to add in logic for showing an explosion and gameover circumstance etc.
Do you have a python interpreter?
OK, so open it.
And then simply "python c:/wherever.py"
Yeah, to be honest I know nothing about using Python with Windows.
I remember it being a goddamned pain.
Within a network I assume?

hey, MileyRayCyrus .
for object in missilelist: object.applygravity()
Classes are data structures that describe things like ships and missiles and stars.
That's half of it.
The other half is that they can contain member functions that allow you to interact with the object.
But yeah, you seem to be way over your head, ShameOnATrip. You should really just read a book.
Oh, really? I only added them as member functions for tidyness' sake.
If you can do that and keep it looking nice and neat then feel free.
OK, I'm going to do some basic gravity stuff and then hit the hay.
Because that's what I said I was going to do in the first place.
HOO YEAH BOYYYY
I hopy you like gravity.
I just put that fucker in ORBIT.
Pushing now.
Pushed.
Gravity's a bit strong and the code's not very elegant but it works nicely.
hahahaha
Well, the trouble is that it seems to get a bit grainy when I try to apply light gravity.
But that's a start for us anyway.
We need to clearly use floats in a number of places if we're going ot get this working properly.
I might be able to jump on to IRC but I'm literally busy from sunrise until sunset tomorrow.
I'll catch you tomorrow, man.
And everybody else. Later, dudes.
Shush, Macbot.
Hey, Tab.
Yeah, looks good, agaric.
Immediately after I left last night I realised that my equation for calculating gravity was wrong.
I was all, like, "Gravitational force should be INVERSELY proportional to distance. Duh!"

MY ONLY REGRET
IS THAT I HAD
BONEITIS
What's your error?
Have you tried the alternative install CD?
Barring that, get Debian.
http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/alternative-download#alternate
For people who have trouble with the LiveCD.
I use Debian Stable, but I don't recommend it for everyone.
It only works for me because I manage a lot of my own software through git/svn/hg
I like stable libs and manually install more up-to-date versions of the pieces of software I want.
And compile them from source.
Which obviously isn't for everyone. It's a very personal way of working.
No probs.
Non-graphical install ftw.
I think so, too.
I'm re-watching star Trek: TNG at the rate of one episode a night when I go to bed.
And I've hit a bunch of episodes I've never seen before.
Which is awesome.
It's great.
Bunch of character-driven episodes, which are the best ones.
The ones where Roddenberry was basically getting shoved off of the show and it started getting good.
Like an episode where Data gets taken by a collector and decided to take a life (which he's never done before.)
And the one where Troi starts seeing Worf.
Character development episodes. yes.
Some shows get the balance all wrong and you get to the point where if you miss an episode you don't have a clue what's going on.
Like later X-Files and Lost.
But TNG did it right.
Fanservice tends to be more like little details in the background or a single line callback rather than complete "myth arc" episodes.
I think you're probably talking about myth arc episodes.
Ones that develop an overall story and the characters.
Hah.
Oh yes, that kind of fanservice as well.
Star Trek was better when Gene Roddenberry wasn't involved at all.
I mean... he had a great vision but he tended to write bad episodes about planets where all the aliens have a specific ideology.
And make a social statement.
Which is fine to a point.
I actually can't watch the original series it's so bad.
And I'm a pretty big fan of everything else trek.
Same.
TNG crew was best crew.
7 seasons.
So something like 180.
And 4 movies.
The first and last of which are awful.
DS9 is good but you can't look at it the same way when you've seen babylon 5.
DS9 had a much larger budget but Bab 5 had the vision and best writing.
Probably my favourite Sci-Fi show of all time.
I'm not allowed to watch it because it makes me feel funny in my pants.
Love bab 5.
I have the boxed set with all the episodes and movies.

Hey, this book I'm reading. I think I mentioned it before.
Anathem, it's called.
I'm just a nadger's over half way and it's insane.
Strong contender for best book I've ever read.
First chapter's a bit slow because neal Stephenson uses a ton of made up words but as you begin to learn what the words mean/their etymology and other meanings it's actually insane.
Honestly. It's up there with Neil Gaiman's American Gods and R.A. Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy.
Also, Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire rates pretty highly but I'm not all that about her other books.
It's on my list.
As are Snow Crash and Stranger In A Strange Land.
Also,
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Burning_Chrome
Yes, I most likely will.
They're all <300 pages so I'll be happy to read the lot.
I might even read "Burning Chrome" first.

Word up, y'all.
Anybody used xmonad?
I'm not really interested in using it but configuring it seems to be a good way of going over some of the reading for Haskell I've been doing.
Love the language but suck at it currently.
Xmonad is Haskell.
And it weighs in at only 2MB more RAM-intensive than dwm.
It actually seems to be quite a nice window manager.
And, of course, the config file is Haskell.
It's really a very niche market when you think about it.

My girlfriend's been playing my Puzzle Quest: Galactrix recently.
So I bought her a copy. £10. Bargain.
And then I bought myself a £25 book on Haskell.
Because I'm worth 2.5 of her.
I liked the original Puzzle Quest but I found it really hard to play a lot of.

Haskell > You

c > Python > Haskell
I will admit this.
But I like them all.
Also Python == Perl.
Also your mum is pretty awesome, too.
I didn't understand that sentence at all.
But I've liked Haskell from my first introduction to it.
But I've actually really struggled ot learn it.
I can handle recursion and purely functional programming after having learned CLisp but Haskell is... HARD if you already have an established mindset you go to when programming.
C is simple and makes sense.
It feels pretty natural to learn.
You can learn C++ as an extension of C later.
I know enough x86 ASM to get by.
I can program in it but more often than not it Ise it inline as part of a program written in C.
If you're interested you could always start with High-Level Assembly.
C's great. Learn it.
Tottally up to you.
They're both very different and you'll take different things away from learning each. it's prefectly fine to bounce between learning the two (which will have the side effect of making your learning of both feel fresh).
K & R "The C Programming Language" is pretty much all you'll ever need.
It's the only C book I own.
I just changed my Super+c calculator link from "urxvtcd -e bc" to "urxvtcd -e ghci". Am I a hipster now?

The problem isn't Ubuntu, it's the default DE.
sudo aptitude install awesome lxde xfce4 openbox fluxbox
And try them out.
It's close enough to a full DE.
But, then, using a full DE is pretty shit-tier anyway.
Again, though... there's no real reason to completely switch distros when you could simply change your setup yourself.
WiFi not restarting = DE problem.
Install wicd.
It's a daemon and isn't tied to gnome.
You'll also have to remove gnome-network-manager.

The problem is actually that the connection manager runs on top of GNOME as a DE rather than as a daemon like glorious UNIX-like master race should, neter.

If you follow lazyfoo's tutorials you could probably start messing with SDL right away.

You'll suck until you can linked list and manage memory but you can get started.

SDL is written in C.
Also, lazyfoo's tutorials are in C++.

That's no way to live your life.
have you tried booting in single user mode?
You did something wrong.
Probably didn't NULL-terminate that string like I told you.
Yes.
OK, pastebin the code if you want a hand.
Oh, I did notice you weren't allocating enough stack space for the string as well.
char[9] gives you 9 "spaces" to fill from 0-8.
You were making an array of 9 chars and filling 0-9 inclusive.
That's cool, then, so long as you're not trying to put a char in syl[10].
Yup.
Although it looks like the segfault is in your logic.
When you compile you can use the -g flag.
And then "gdb <program name>" brings you into a shell.
And then you can type "run" and find your segfault.
You seem to be trying to print a string instead of a character.
PROTIP: You can do
char syl[] = "aeiou kyln";
Ignore everything but K&R.
"This" is the same as {'t', 'h', 'i', 's'};
Congratulations!
hrm.
Soudns like you're accessing other areas of the stack.
Oh, wait, you mean on line 12?

OK, now go streamline the per-monitor window linked list in jdwm.

Yes.
I actually find it difficult to concentrate with any music on but it's better than listening to someone playing computer games or trying to have a conversation with me.
Tell me more, FordPrefect.
Same, naosia.
Are you a musician at all, naosia? I find that I tend to listen very intently to music because I study music as a hobby.
You mean neurotropics, FordPrefect?
basically ,music is bad because it gets my full attention.

ADHD isn't a real thing, learningcode.

The problem isn't the person, learningcode. The problem is the environment.
I honestly think I'll opt out of the school system when I have children. I did some research into it and found out that it's perfectly legal in the U.K.
Be honest: I think pretty much everyone here will say that they felt restricted by the school system.
Hah. XD
children don't need strict tutoring.
maybe back in the day when we had to buy books to facilitate learning but not so much now.
I love books, don't get me wrong.
But people who want to seek out knowledge have the internet. Don't tell everyone because I'm thyinking about buying shares but this internet thing's going to be big.
Books are one of my few sentimentalities. I got rid of DVDs and CDs and pretty much everything I owned 4 or 5 years ago. Most of my books, too.
Although that's unfortunate, learningcode, from a practical point of view it won't be a problem for me or my children.
Are you implying that a child who doesn't go to school will lack education, auREAX?
Ah, now this is an issue I've discussed in depth.
I have several friends who have recently become fully qualified teachers and worked for several years as teaching assistants.
The kids that don't care are the ones with parents that don't care. Always.
Many developmental psychologists believe that interracting solely with children of your own age is detrimental to development, learningcode.
The other kids that have problems are the ones who are bored with a fixed rate of development.

Back.
roladka: It's a set of tools including an image scraper and dupe checker(/remover) for 4chan.
Although the dupechecker actually doesn't have anything hard-coded to tie it to 4chan.
And it's the exact same functionality implemented in a half dozen or more languages (same flags and I/O) to show people how to achieve the same results in different languages.
Also, it was good practise to write them. The Perl, Python2 and C tools were written by me.
And I'll write the Haskell ones eventually.
They probably still need work, agaric. people are always welcome to come in and help the project.
The Python2 ones and Perl ones should be pretty much perfect, though. From what I remember we were going to base everything off of the Python one.
3>implying anybody else writes them anyway
Chanscan might be nice. I'd be happy to duplicate the behaviour in different langs when ren is done.
Yes, [`^_^`].
I still think we should have used my perl archiver as a base.

Manhose is the Windows user. My OS is actually nice ot program Python with.

Also, does cmd.exe finally have tab-completion for binaries in the PATH?
And tab-completion for path names for selecting the script to run?
That ~1 shit gets old, too.
probably because Microsoft realised that everyone else has a nice CLi shell to work with.
How does it improve on bash?
argv is a list of arguments to the program. I believe its "type" is a tuple.
I don't know if I described that very well...
So... you can make your own tuples and argv is a tupple supplied ot you.

Much more comp sci in the original as well.
"Oh, I get it -- you're a bit!" ***YES***
Yup.
The original talks much more about users and freedom.
It's a not-so-allegorical look at programs restricting users and other programs.

There aren't really any pieces in the toolbox written in perl because I'm the only person who uses it.
Just some versions of the standard tools that I wrote way back.
Actually, there are a couple of pieces that need making, greyhat.
These are the standard tools in Python: https://github.com/gentoomen/4chantoolbox/tree/master/Python2
And they need to be made the same (with the same I/o and without too much change to the internal structure) in Perl.
I made one of them already.: https://github.com/gentoomen/4chantoolbox/tree/master/Perl
In fact, that one scraper that's in there doesn't comply to those rules at all.
Basically yes, greyhat.
the idea is that it's good practise and the finished product serves as a good reference for beginners about how to implement the same thing in different languages.
Baller.
I can't remember who maintains the github account but you're free to submit merge requests until whoever gives you commit access.
You don't need any special permissions to request changes be added.
But commit access will allow you to do that for yourself.
Also, until your changes are merged or committed you'll effectively be maintaining a branch.

renjikken is looking at adding to my nyancat screensaver to make it work for Windows.
How do you feel about us branding it as Gentoomen?
c:\Program Files\Gentoomen\Nyancat as an install path and all that.
renjikken's an official Gentooman, right?
Well, if you contribute the Windows part, renjikken, then it becomes 8our* project.
Anybody know what libs you would use for Windows in place of Xinerama?
Just a simple list of rectangles for monitors would be good.
Oh my word.
Multimonitor programming for Windows seems like a total clusterfuck.
Why can't it just give me a big virtual surface and report rectangles for monitors?
I can grab rectangles on a surface for monitors with Xinerama and shove them into a linked list in probably about 15 lines of C.
It looks like to do the same with Windows you'll have to create a surface for EACH MONITOR.
.NET "screen class"
Looking to see if there are other ways to do it.
It's also extremely C unfriendly ;_;
Because you have to iterate. yes.
Not at all. It's just slow if you have to count all the way to 100 to know where object #100 is.
Let me knock you up some code with the training wheels left on, chown.
Urg. Why can't I think of somethign we would want to store in a list?
In a linked list, specifically.
that's correct, chown.
And you start with the first one and follow the pointer to the next one until ->next == NULL.
That's how you iterate through all of them.
Ah yes, doubly linked lists go backwards, too.
Lists that are linked in a circle are great for displaying things in a cool way, for example.
Imagine you have a character select screen, for example.
Or an image viewer.
And you want to be able to show the selections on either side.
But the selections aren't big enough to fill the whole screen.
voila, cool repetition of your linked list in either direction fillign the screen.
chown: http://ompldr.org/vOGdjeQ
Simple example of how to make, fill and display the contents of a linked list.
OK. :)
I understand totally.
Once you can do that you'll most likely know enough C to join in coding.
And hack on dwm etc.
Hrm.
I can't remember what example K&R gives for linked lists.
I bet they do an awesome job of explaining it, though.
WM
There's something graceful about linked lists.
Really? I think perhaps that's true if people learn to code at university.
I think the average self-taught C programmer is otherwise.
C++*
I have literally no idea. I think it may have been a map object that contained co-ordinates and a link to an image.
i.e. for map tiles.
There's almost always a better way to do it.
If you're working with strings in a computationally intensive way you're probably doing it wrong.
If you're working with strings in a very minor way than NULL-terminated is nice and simple.

Hey Manhose, you ever solve the 8 queens problem with a program?
Place 8 queens on a chess board in positions where no queen is able to capture another.
The program to do it is somewhat of a rite of passage.
I did it in BASIC in ~90.
Some faggot's totally overcomplicated it on /g/ and asked people to debug his awful faulty logic.

There was a game that came out for the MegaCD called Ground Zero: Texas where you had to collect a bunch of numbers to use to deactivate a bomb.
And you would work from the other direction and eliminate numbers.
I had a BBC Micro in my bedroom next to the console. Made a program to list all the potential combinations so that I could work through them systematically with a save-load deal.
No, haakon. You make your own LL structures.
Please tell me you're not saying Java has a linked list primitive...
Oh, wow. I just realised something.
As much as "son, I was programming before you were born" is a cliche.
Manhose: I was happily tapping away on my ZX Spectrum and BBC Micro before you were born.
How does that feel?
I've always hated DOS.
Probably because a simple BBC BASIC interpreter from '81 was more usable than every MS-DOS ever released. I *KNEW* there was a better shell from the second I started using it.
Hey, The BBC Micro had tab completion.
What years were 5.0 and 6.22 released?
Guesstimate is good neough.
One part curiosity, one part "MS-DOS was a pile of shit" confirmation.
Right, I have to see what all the complaining is about. I'm installing Unity on my netbook.

I managed to get "style keys" aka userstyles included in surf already.

From surf.1:

Install dmenu. It's good.
The idea is that you change its Xproperties to change uri.
ctrl-g just opens (as default) an easy dmenu to set the Xproperty.
It's just a quick launcher.

I just want to make something that's 100% what I want and 0% anything else.
Well, when I'm done maybe I'll look at making some optional extensions.

Back in the day if you wanted to play computer games you wither had a NES or you typed your shit out of a book in BASIC.

I respond awfully to a class environment for coding.
yeah, chown. Tell us.
A class in an object that contains both data and functions.
A struct is an object that contains data.

Yes.
Do you could have a class human and then create "LAMMJohnson" a an instance of that object.
as an*
and "copypaste" as another and "chown" as another.
some people speculate that I'm part of a Turing test.
Any non-primitive data. A group of variables.
You're probably familiar with integers and floating point numbers. they're primitives.
Python even treats these primitives as objects, so you don't really need to know the difference.
And objects contain other objects, too.
So an object of type "car" can also contain a a list of up to 5 "person" objects and an object of type "engine" and 4 objects of type "wheels" etc.
And an object of type "wheels" might contain variables/objects of types "circumference", "brand", "material", "wear", "thickness" etc.
You get the idea.
Close enough. You still have the logic and you have to remember that many programming languages have primitives.

I did my CCNA a while back and thought I'd never use any of it because it was Cisco-specific.
And now I've forgotten pretty much the entire second half of what I learnt.
i.e. the Cisco-specific stuff.
Whose certification is A+?
CCNA is either awesome or a rip-off depending on what you're going to do with it.
I know a couple of guys who have gotten awfully dull but decent-paying jobs as "the IT guy" off the back of a CCNA.
Don't know anybody who's done a CCNP or other higher Cisco qual but I expect it's a magnification of the same effect.
I don't know why you'd want a job working with anything you cover in networking quals anyway. It's all godawful boring stuff.

Oh well. Guess I'll just stick some half-baked baguettes in the oven.
You want to know my honest opinion of why I think people are voting against the AV?
I think people just want to align themselves with a political party and moan about others.
It's a personal identity thing.
And if people put "#1: Labour 2:Conservatives" on their voting form they a) are idiots and b) lose the right to complain when Conservatives take seats.
Same.
Why would you vote like that? It makes no sense.
There are other parties with policies closer to Labour's. People would just be voting for what they know.
Which is dumb.
conservative-liberal..?
As in 3 separate parties?
Because conservative = rev(liberal)
At least you have some liberals in government.
Yech.
That's not liberal, then. That sounds right-wing libertarian.
The most evil and greedy political standpoint.

Yes, I declare it as inline in my predecs. I think that's C99 standard.
I'm not aware of how C++ handles inline functions.
What's C++ do?
Whatcha working on that's in need of performance optimisation?
Use bitwise operators.
24 rows of 3 bytes.
Don't really. It's a ridiculously unnecessary optimisation.
If you use a bool you're actually going to have to use a piece of memory the length of your procerros' word length.
i.e. a short or int.
But if you used bitwise operators you could actually cram more than a row into each int.
You really don't need to do it.
It's not really something you should atcually consider doing. The code would be far less readable.
And I'm sure you can spare 576 bytes.

That's a "someone else will help you don't ask Johnson" problem.
Aptly named.
Once you realise that variables you declare are actually just pointers to preallocated memory on the stack you're good to go.
Link the code, dumdum? It's incredibly hard to see what you're doing without context.
Interesting exercise.
You're giving the dictionary object a function to find within itself?
I like it.
So your dictionary contains a number of entries that are Code: Name
And then you're making a link to a function at cities['_find'] to find_city.
So now when you do cities['find'](whatever, whatever) it uses the function find_city.
I don't understand why you would use it like that, though. I fail to see why you need to make what is effectively a pointer to that function and then call the pointer.
dumdum: When your create a boolean evalution condition your computer simplifies it down until the end result is either "true" or "false".
(1 == 1 && 2 == 3) simplified down to
(True &7 False)
Which simplified down to False.
So after simplification that statement becomes
while False:
Sorry, "&&" means "and".
while (1 and 1) simplifies to while true.
Study hard. C next.
Which is fine because there's actually less to learn of C anyway, IMHO.

It goes against everything I value as a programmer.
"The code is the documentation."
Also, fuck you ers.

Yeah, Python pretty much gets you to the point where you're writing code as fast as you can think it.
But my main problem is that there's this whole lazy attitude towards programming (that Java encourages) that is simply not acceptable.
When you write a program you *should* slave over it and make it ruthlessly efficient.
because, potentially, millions of people are going ot use that software.
And your inefficiency is magnified a millionfold.

Messy.
it64 is an archetecture.
You don't want ia-64
You want x86 or x86_64.
ia-64 is a completely different processor type.
amd64 = x86+64
x86_64*
^
x86 actually means 186, 286, 386, 486, 586 and 686 architectures.
x86_64 means an x86 processor extended with amd64 instruction set.
So why ask?
x86_64 software can run x86 programs.
There was some degree of incompatibility some years ago but it's not a problem now.
Because a program compiled for x86 assumes certain things about address space and word length, for example, that don't apply to x86_64.
Also, Linux 32-on-64 bit support > Windows 32-on-64 bit support.

Why not just use a 2d array?

Your mum's an iteration.
OK, whichever way works for you.
So, are you gonna dump source?
Oh, I had no link. Must have been netsplit madness.
1 neighbour = death, right?
The index is hard to understand, again, because of the 2d nature of your array.
Printing co-ordinates next to your cells and saying "cell at 0,7 lives" would be much easier.
1d*
Also, you're not srand-ing.
So your board isn't actually random.
I won't comment on a bunch of other stuff because I feel I'm impinging upon your learning experience.
Instead I'll just focus on your live/die logic.
yeah, it's definitely your number_of_neighbour logic.
... or is it?
number_of_neighbours is off...
No, I think a 2d array is your best bet.
or you'll be iterating through that entire list every time looking for cells around each cell.
Which would be woefully inefficient.
This whole ROWS COLS thing is confusing as hell.
OK.
To declare the array, I would imagine.
And apply bounds to loops.

Yeah, I fixed the problems in main by switching x and y.
But there are problems elsewhere.
Line 57 jumps out at me.
Yes, renjikken, but remember that the first number is a multiplier.

But [60][55] resolves as (60*60) + 55

Oh, wait... segfault after the first itaration. looks like the update loop segfaults, too.
Line 78
Same problem but a slightly different situation to wrap my head around.
ROWS 50 and COLS 50 works perfectly.
And yeah, logic seems to be a bit off in your num_neighbours function. These stable shapes shouldn't be stable.
Looks like Conway did count diagonals.

renjikken is going to update his Game Of life to use it, I think.
Like a baws.
That sentence made no sense.
SDL's not really very low-level.
If I remember correctly SDL only allocates screen memory in powers of 2 as well.
Oh, I forgot to mention, Manhose.
My Launchpad came 3 months ago.
It's still in the packaging. Not even opened it.
Why would SDL remind you of Wouter van Oortmerssen, Tanami? I don't believe he ever did any work on it.
renjikken: You should leave the option of ASCII-out in your game of life.
i.e. give peopel the option of SDl or stdout for graphics.
Either from a flag or at compile time.
Might be a good excuse to pick up makefiles and configure scripts.
Runtime is good, too. You're hardly packing the binary out with shit by leaving 15 lines of code for text output in.
Although compiling without SDL might be a nice option.
Also, your updates are still off.
If you run the program with an area longer than it is wide then the lower portion never gets updates. Just the upper square.
Just use an ifdef SDL then sdl_sleep elsif __linux__ then use unistd.h else use the windows headder.
A bit more complex than it needs to be but good practise.
x and y co-ordinates screwy still.
Yeah, so, here are the bugs:
Segfault if COLS > ROWS.
Only a square area being updated if ROWS > COLS
Welcome to the wonderful world of bug hunting.
It's reproducable here always. Not sure if anyone else can confirm.
brb reading.
That's a mistake.
Don't dynamically allocate it. The code will no longer be generating a segfault because it'll be accessing memory of a page the program owns.
But still the wrong memory.
You think the compiler's making a mistake? I think it's more likely the logic's off.
But you seem to be dealing with it. I'll get back to reading.
The stack will be allocated in its entirety before main is started.
Do you know asm, Manhose? Everything outside of a function's scope is shoved into "section .data" when compiled.
Or "section .bss" depends.
Anyway, I'm side-tracking you.
Hint: Line 65
Should be [y][x]
I believe.
It's certainly where the segfault is happening.
Couple of lines later that I'm eyeballing as next in line to segfault.
You need to be clear about which element is your x co-ordinate and which is your y co-ordinate and stick to it.
You'll probably have to go over all your logic that contains ROWS or COLS as well.
And make sure you're referring to the right thing.
That's when you say one thing but you mean amother.
Eh
EEEHHH
Classic.
Bet you'll use that one next time someone mentions a freudian Slip.
I wondered what that smell was.

Latin all up in this motherfucker.
Eh. I did 2 years of it in boarding school. never liked it.
The only interesting thing about Latin is if you end up finding a word with some interesting piece of etymology that goes back to latin.
And that's about it.
INTEGRUM X = CLIV
I'm not convinced that's a real word.
Hah. Forgot about X.
Tabletop RPGs are fun
Anybody who doesn't play them isn't worthy of the coveted title of neckbear.
I only have one qualm with significant whitespace and that's that I can't automatically format a piece of source.
Open a file in vim and type gg=G, redlizard.
No text editor can automatically format your code for you if you have significant whitespace.
But there's one key difference between Lisp and Python: Your sections have delimiters.
No piece of software can tell where you want your loop or conditional statement to end.
Unless you, the user, drops indentation.
You may as well ask your text editor to put all your closing braces in for you.
Write your whole program without closing braces and then have your text editor add them all in one go.
Not gonna happen.
because that's what you'd be expecting it to do with formatting a Python file.
Which is fine.
Urg.
I simply said that Python has a major weakness in that it can't be automatically formatted. the rest of the discussion was as a result of that being refuted.
Which is incorrect. Python can't be automatically formatted.
No, I think it's got a place.
In collaborative coding for one.
Sure, you can do it hackishly vine.
But if you're writing comments you may as well just format it manually.
that's correct, Tanami. In that situation FIOC has a place.
No comment.
hey, redlizard -- you mentioned you play tabletop RPGs?
What do you play?
4e.POS?
I DMed for my girlfriend and a bunch of her uni friends last time I went down to visit. It's a really bland system.
Yup.
I haven't played D&D in years in favour of points-based games like GURPS.
And, my favourite, The Hero System (of which Champions is a part).
Just about to google it.
Fantasy genre?
Not really my thing.
oh, pirates.
Well, that sounds interesting.
Class-based?
... OK, sounds like it has potential.
Did you play the (yeck) d20 version?
Sounds like an interesting mechanic.
I might grab a copy.

They understand the hardware better. They understand the basic principles of computer science better. They know how networks work better than you. They understand the pros and cons of filesystems (including NTFS and HFS+) because with Linux you get to choose filesystems. They can probably program, too, since learning a scripting language vastly improves productivity under Linux (and this really pisses you off, since program

Love the field. Worked for a company that designed embedded systems for a while.

So most of it was asm.

Never actually used Pascal.
A lot of what you'll end up doing if you write for embedded systems if you need to be really ruthless is either inline asm or using a compile to spit out some basic asm and tweaking.

I guess it's just kind of disheartening to know that wherever you go to work you'll basically be a shitmuncher until you work your way up.

Just start making some of your more performance-intensive functions in asm.

Little metal pipe. Held it in while my bud spun me round.
SERIOUS hallucinations.
Massive feeling of nostalgia. had some music on in the background and the walls were swirling.
Lasted maybe 5 minutes whilst i laughed my bollocks off and drueled like an idiot.
then I felt stoned for maybe half an hour.
I didn't know at the time but apparently the "swirling" hallucination is a common thing.
No, I was present.
none of us had out-of-body.
One of my friends said it felt like there was a pole down the middle of his body and he was being pulled backwards.
It was fun. I always talk abotu gettign some for festivals but never do.
Man, I can't find the picture.
I saw a really good picture of the swirling effect ages ago. thought it was on wikipedia but apparently not.

$#ARGV is returning a number that seems too low...
"./test.pl -b g" reports only 1 arg.
yeah. Looks like it's been long enough since I've done Perl arg handling that I can't remember the eccentricities.
That's definitely the problem, though.
Using @ARGV gives the args correctly.
Yes, auREAXiki. You remember your Perl arg handling? greyhat needs some help.
It *IS* a good thing, chown.
If you can't figure out how to use it then dwm isn't for you.
I was about to bring up getopt.
Well, I personally agree with him.
They're not trying to keep stupid kids out.
They're just not of the mindset to constantly be giving people help on simple things that should be self-obvious.
^
Which makes the code simpler.
make && sudo make install
Done.
Saves 200+ LOC for a parser.
dwm doesn't have a configure script.
Which is fine. Lots of people do prefer a config file.
Those people should definitely use scrotwm.
I have it installed and I always try to have a look at the WMs other people are using.
But I've never used it seriously.
Yes. I maintain a fork.
scrotwm it is, then.
Check out my nyancat program.
Doesn't get much simpler than that.
Or you could read the lazyfoo tutorials but they tend to teach you how to do it badly first and then re-teaches you how to do it properly.
In particular are you planning on using sprites or simply drawing a grid and colouring squares?
Yeah, just look at the init stuff early in main() (it's messy -- I should really have dumped that into an init function) and the draw_square and put_pixel functions.
Never used it, actually.

My girlfriend knows to fear me when I'm trying to work.
They came for your expertise.
Oh WOW.
Why is he not wearing a red shirt?
Stallman's exactly right here. The law even specifies that you have to specifically show an implementation of an idea rather than a general idea to obtain a patent.
Murkka seems to care very little about that, though. Murkka  hands out patents in some ridiculous "unless someone challenges it it's fine" kind of a way.
Oh, sweet. I didn't realise that GPLv3 gives you a degree of protection against patent trolls.

It's good practise to declare your variables as static in case you end up extending your project with multiple files.
Still.
Good practise is good practise.
Well, you can choose not to declare your variables and functions as static if you want. Makes no difference to me.
Your position-working logic is off.
I believe that's what's causing the segfault but I might be wrong.
  Looks like your y-coordinate is a bit buggy.
I think you could be attempting to draw to an area of the surface beyond bounds.
Hrm.
I haven't even looked at the code yet. Trying ot make the error properly reproducable.
And yes, sometimes only the Y co-ordinate is displayed.
And annoyingly the segfault doesn't happen within gdb.
Where's your click-handling logic?
Hah. I hope when I wrote my first C program it didn't look like this. XD
Nah, don't take that the wrong way. I actually think you're doing really well.
Just divide and use floor?
Yup.
It might even fix your segfault problem handling it that way.
You could also do with perhaps just throwing in some error checking.
Just make sure your X and Y cell co-ords are within bounds before you draw.
Although that shouldn't be necessary if you're doing things properly. Perhaps just do an if-else and spit out a warning if your X or Y co-ords are coming up funky.
Make sure to use floor though, renjikken. Integer rounding can be a bit of a crapshoto without it.
Boom.
Simple solutions to problems like that are always the best.

You should really be breaking it up into smaller functions, renjikken.
Whether you want to do that now or just get it working and then beautify it is up to you.
There's also a degree of personal preference.
But generally speaking, even if your function will only be used once it helps understanding of the code to have it piecemeal.

g_object_set(G_OBJECT(settings), "user-stylesheet-uri", g_strconcat("file://", uri, NULL), NULL);
Which would simplify downto something like g_object_set(G_OBJECT(settings), "user-stylesheet-uri", sheet_filepath, NULL);

This shouldn't interfere with your plans to become an enterprise dev.
So. Would now be a good time to mention I found a buffer overrun bug in bhottu that allows you to remotely execute ~50 bytes of Python script on the host machine?
Not really. that would be awesome though, no?
I bet I could find an exploit if I wanted to.
50 bytes would easily be enough to do some serious nasty stuff.
Given a bit of time you could actually do anything you needed with 50 bytes of python.
Yeah... wgetting and executing a script is enough to get you started.

Sounds good, renjikken.
Oh, you know what? I pulled earlier and didn't check out your new features.
My girlfriend uses Awesome.
Clearly.
She actually sucks but she's been an extremely attentive learner.
Set her up with Ubuntu 10.10 last year and she's been using it ever since. learning how to use the terminal, for example.
She doesn't seem capable of programming, although I had planned to teach her Python.
She wouldn't shut up about how nice it is to have multiple desktops in GNOME for a long time and when I set her up with awesome in January she took to it.
I think she struggles to understand what the computer is doing.
It's hard for her to see through the abstraction. Until early last year she basically just knew how to use MS Word and check Facebook.
She'll get it but she needs to use her computer more before she'll be able to pick it up.
And yeah, I agree. best to let her settle in to what she's got now and explore for herself a bit.
Oh dear. ;_;
My first computer was a BBC Micro and the only way to interact with it was through a BASIC interpreter.
You pretty much had to know how to program it to use it.
It also had no non-volatile memory so you had to program it again every time you turned it off.
It also only has 512KB of RAM.
had*
At least I have a cool story to tell people when we talk about first computers and first programming languages.
Nothing confusing about elif.
With an additional clause.
Not a tough one to wrap your head around.
if (girl.age < 12) return "No way" elif (girl.age < 16) return "maybe but don't get caught" elif (girl.age < 22) return "Good to go!" else return "Too old."

3>awwww, he already built it somewhat :(
Wonder if he still went ahead with it.
Good luck, renjikken. It's a great first step into tiling.
It's an efficient way to manage windows, ohnana, and doesn't have as steep of a learning curve as other tiling WMs.
The WMs you see every day are floating WMs.
Tiling WMs automatically use all available space and allow you to move your windows about effectively with the keyboard.
Uh-huh.
And tags are a major part. You can group windows together in virtual workspaces.
It takes some learning and there are quite a few different options out there. Once you've got the hang of it you could never go back, though.
Waste of time.
Well, fair enough. Enjoy your inefficient clicking and dragging.
I'm so far into desktop Satori I can't even use tiling WMs any more.
My windows are monocled by default and I can switch to tiling if I need it. Which is rarely.
Monocled = window is full screen. Can have multiple windows on each tag and I can cycle through them.
Mod4+t switches the windows on a tag to be tiled.
Mod4+m switches back.
Pretty much never take my hands off of the home keys.
Yeah, that becomes 2nd nature.
Mod4+i/+o switches me between my monitors.

Every single one of them.
Hey, chown: question for you.
How do you feel about this new trend of trying to find a genetic basis for homosexuality?
Feels like deflecting to me.
Sounds like the best kind of compiler.
Because it removes any idea of blame or responsibility from the equation, Ford.
Homosexuals aren't genetically or hormonally different.
It's not a rational decision, renjikken, I accept that.
The girls I'm attracted to aren't based upon rational decisions either. I do accept that I have reasons in my subconscious and because of the life experience I have so far that makes me attracted to those girls, though.
No, they're not renjikken.
I bet every girl you're subconsciously attracted to -- your type -- you have a stone-cold reason for it somewhere way back in your past.
There is no proof of human pheremones.
pheromones*
Yeah, perhaps now is another good chance for me to state that I'm a fairly hardline determinist.
Of course you can, renjikken.
3>Implying I don't go for redheads because I kissed a redheaded girl in 3rd grade
Because that's the process you go through when you allow yourself to see, rationally, why you made those decisions renjikken.
I don't want to make babies with redheads. I just like redheads because I had an early sexual experience with one and I have an association.
Say what you want, Manhose. I clearly do have an association. You do it all through childhood and it shapes the adult you become very strongly.
Actually, I'm guilty of oversimplifying to people who are going to taker an analogy too far.
3>implying fetish and sexuality are formed in different ways.
Homosexuality is the same as a fetish. You don't choose a fetish and you don't have to justify it or claim you genetically liek stockings.
I don't see the need to try and separate the two. if anything I feel it confuses matters. Homosexuality is some kind of don't-talk-about-it taboo and the kind of all fetishes.
king*
learningcode! i knew that bastard would come in handy at some point.
learningcode is the perfect example of a guy whose fetish is playing with gender identity.
I know I'm not going to prove it and I don't particularly mind.
The two aren't different.
If anything, renjikken, I believe that it's the simplest logical conclusion.
So your argument against, renjikken, is that it's a matter of scale?
Seems more like you've been living in a society that separates the 2 and makes it difficult to see them as one and the same.
Not at all.
people choose to kill themselves or have a vasectomy.
We disobey biological imperative all the time. every time we wear a condom.
Well maybe not you but certainly me.
Being gay is a mental disorder? OK, I think this has gone on long enough.
I'm clearly not going to change anyones minds and that's not really what I set out to do.
I just think people hugely play up the genetic and underplay the behavioural.
inb4 gay uncle theory
People are just being gay to lull women into a false sense of security so that they can rape them?
I LIKE IT!
Yeah, if I'm feeling lonely I fuck a nerd.
Easy scores.
Yeah, but people assume I'm not a nerd. People are normally pretty surprised to even see that I have 2 monitors.
I have some money.
I don't know how people even work with one monitor.
When I visit my girlfriend with my little netbook I have to borrow a monitor.
I have a 1280x1024 and 1920x1080.
Ford: I just find it really natural to have things fullscreen and a separate monitor allows me to throw something over to my off-side to work with while I focus on whatever main project I'm working on.
3>Manhose
3>GF
Naw, Bandit, look at Manhose's pictures. You'll understand.
That, by the way chown, is one of the reasons I dislike the genetic view over the behavioural view of homosexuality.
Because the genetic view implies in some way that there's something wrong with you.
Mm. Perhaps. I think they're both ridiculous views.
Yeah... Seriously, though. We should fix that.
Oh, I see. moving.

Oh no, tetsuo42. Clearly we'd be cloning the original.
And maybe bringing over some functionality from #2.
Because #3 is a huge 3d game.
And still officially supported by a huge company.
We'd get legal threats so quickly it wouldn't even be funny.
Also 1&2 > 3
I thought you might say as much.
I would gun for C. the game's not very complex and I think C would suit us just fine.
Plus I know how to be ruthlessly efficient with C. I could really tighten the bolts as we go along.
Clearly OpenGL if we go the 3d route.
Again, though, look at OpenTTD -- SDL is a good choice for us to use if we want to emulate the original graphics.
And it's easy to use.
The original Populous is like TTD in that it's unplayable on modern systems because of low resolution and requires an emu layer.
hah.
Yes, I think you know what I'm getting at then, kawaii, if you know of OpenTTD.
You should check out OpenTTD, Manhose.
Never played the DS Populous.
ACTION vomits
My vote's for C and SDL and to make for Populous what OpenTTD is for TTD.
brb
Yeah, again, I've got to be against that because I know it's an additional layer of complexity that the project doesn't need.
Well, how about we make it in 2D first and do it properly
And then it will be easy enough to gut out the graphical side of things and make it in 3d afterwards.

It seems to be based in cryptography, though.

Lets just set our sights low and do an easy 2d game first.

And it should be easy to get a working cross-platform prototype.
Because evenry can program C without turning it into a clusterfuck of people using shit other peopel don't know.
inb4 3 implementations of a string class
Bahaha
At least C's small enough that, over the course of a project, a person who knows journeyman C can learn everything that everyone is doing.
There's no reason for it to be anything but cross-platform.
We're using cross-platform libs and if the Makefile will build under Windows.
If you want to package up an .exe with resources into an installer then that would be great.
Also it increases our audience by 90%.
I don't know CMake well, but I'm happy to pick it up and get involved with that.
Which is true, Manhose.
But by developing software that is as platform-independant as can be there's nothign to stop a person building it on Windows.
Compactuating not beign a real word is a tip-off.

Yes, Manhose. Not necessarily a roguelike but close.
For example, rather than square-by-square moving I'd like to do a room-by-room game.
i.e. select a door, pick the lock/kick it in/open it, enter a fight, loot.

I'm pleased that she wants to knuckle down and learn a scrip[ting language.
I wouldn't have initially suggested Lua but if it has a practical use for her then it's the best way to start.
I don't know it very well.
The syntax is a bit odd to me but I do like its ability ot be integrated easily with C.
I actually wouldn't mind learning it to the point of being my 3rd most proficient scripting language.
Python > Perl > Lua ?
Ruby? Pass.
Ruby doesn't do anything that I'd not rather do with Perl or Python.
I don't see it, Manhose.
What does it do that I can't do better with Perl or Python?
We all know that OO isn't my thing.
But I believe Python does OO better.
If you won't concede that then we can at least agree that they're similarly easy.
BASIC isn't a general-purpose language.

So yeah, as far as how scripting language uses go I put Ruby in the same category as PHP.
I'll learn it if I ever decide to web dev with it.

And I know 2 web scripting languages.
And I'm about to learn another language because of how nicely it embeds.
PHP and javascript, GETOUT.
I don't count Perl as a web scripting language.
Because I hate web dev.

malloc is the simplest thing in the world to understand.
Ask for x bytes of data, malloc find a suitable place to put it (or takes a new page of memory if needed) and returns a pointer to the space.

He wasn't dead. he was just missing.
Well, that's the magic of C. It keeps track of your allocated pages of memory and which bits are used for you.
You can do it manually but you may as well go the whole hog and write an implementation of the c standard lib while you're at it.

The whole point of the shell is that it's BASIC, GETOUT. I'm sure there are other shells out there for what you want.
BASIC was always designed to be a language and a shell both.
It's not platform specific, but I'm running it under Linux.
What's this compiler being written in?
If you say anything but C with inline ASM you're doing it wrong.
Because efficiency is important in a compiler, redlizard.
So wrap it in preprocs.
Write the function in a portable version and then use preprocs to make better platform-specific versions.
Best of both worlds.
I disagree with both.
Deallocation frees a chunk of memory.
free(mypointer) tells the system to have the memory back because you're not using it any more.
If you move mypointer to another location without deallocating the memory it was pointing to then you have a memory leak.
Because you now not only have shit in memory that you're not using, you *also* don't have any references to it to free from.
GETNAPPIN: See above.
If you have shit in memory and no pointers pointing to it that's a memory leak.
because that memory is unusable, unfreeable and wasted.
Correct, GETNAPPIN.
DOUBLEFREE
Dereferencing null pointers just points to memory location 0.
Which causes a segfault.
Because you're not allowed to access that memory.
There's literally a line in stdlib.h that says "#define NULL 0"

It seems a simpler job.
That depends.
Would you be willing to work on a game that would be hard to port to Windows?
Conversely, we could use a simple version of SDL and a character map.

Plus if we're going to be using SDL again in the future it would be good to take advantage of the chance ot becoem more intimate with it.
Hrm. Maybe curses, then.

Also, I'd previously been working with coloured squares as graphcis but I'm going to guy a bunch of that out, drop in some resource manager code I wrote a while back and use rudamentary graphics.
Well, the good news is that there's still a ton of work that I can do without the level-making algo.
Currently I just have an extremely simple algo that dumps walls randomly withing a walled square that'll allow me to work on other things.
Sure, I'll keep a TODO list.
My current itinary: Switch out the darkcolor/lightcolor pairs I currently use for tiles for graphics and fog-of-war.
And then a decent light-path tracing.
And then some basic enemies.
So yeah... It's enough work that I have a little sideline project for a while.
Not sure how much insentive I'll have to work on it on my own but there's a basis there for a group project that'll only become more well-rounded and easier to work with with time.

That's my hackish light fix until I can do proper path tracing.
I'm a fan of "get it working first and tyhen make it nice later."
Also, that's only unreadable if you haven't bothered to look at the Game and Character typedefs and suck at programming.
Game *g;
Char *c;
Character *c *
They're only bad practises if you're using Java or a fag language with variable names like "Game this_is_our_game_instance"
Every instance of the Game type in game.c is g.
Nope.
Have you viewed much of suckless's sources? Especially, I'll use as an example, dwm?
One-character global variables are bad practise. Within scope single-character var names are extremely common.
Well, you're still wrong.
Which is fine. You've recently picked up Java so I can understand why you like to be wordy with your variable names.
I don't have a problem with being more verbose if it helps readibility for others, but a 10-line function declared as "static void my_funct(Data *d, OtherData *od, Loop l)" isn't hard to work with.
Yes, the data structure could do with some more verbosity.
But when you're dealing with a game and c is the player character it's a variable you shouldn't have trouble remembering.
I can understand that. It's a trivial matter to change the variable name to player or similar.

Play breath Of Fire.
Bonus: There are, like, 5 games in the series.
Also, King of the Dragons.
Is probably my favourite side-scrolling beat 'em up of all time.
Better even that Streets of Rage and Golden Axe.
I don't know it.
But I've only played some of #1 and #3.
It's not either of those.
Also, the series has common themes.
The main character has a very specific ability that it in all the games as far as I know.
And there's always a girl with wings.
Also, a bunch of tribes/peoples. Tribe of the dragon. Tribe of the bird etc.
Well, #1 and #2 are SNES so no disc.
I think #3 was PS1.
I played it on PSP.
'morning, all.
brb grabbing a copy of this book for my girlfriend.
Medical student. Gunning for surgeon.
She's interested in pretty much any medical thing she can get her hands on.
And she's become very interested in computers since I switched her over to Ubuntu.
She picked up a little Lua the last time I saw her because she wanted to configure her awesome.
I've never been massively into Lua, but it plays so nicely with C I feel I can't HELP but learn it.
Nonono.
I mean Lua embeds into C like a goddamn BAWS.
You can add in a bunch of hook to your C code and suddenly you're calling C functions from Lua and Lua functions from C.
Like 5 minutes work.
hooks*
Hence why it's was (is) so prolifically used in game development.
I do have some Perl experience. It's been my goto language for quick hacks for years.
Why do you ask about Perl?
Hence why I like the book.
I'm a passionate collaborator but an impatient teacher.
I just get wound up by people that want to be carried.
If you don't have the drive to learn fopr yourself then don't bother learning (and, more importantly, don't bother me to teach you.)

We played pub golf. It was fun.
For anyone that doesn't know Pub Golf: 9 holes. 9 drinks. You score is how many swigs it takes for you to drink them in.
Oh, and everybody dresses like golfers.
As in if you move the liquid away from your mouth or just hold it in your mouth that's the end of your "swing."
Hah. Yes, I can imagine.
There are variations and people sometimes do 18 hoels with wimpy drinks.
But we do 9 holes every year with the same drinks: Fosters tops, double whiskey and tap water, pint of Guinness, alcopop, pint of cider, pint of ale, gin and tonic, tequila, sparkling white wine.
We also do +3 drinks per vom.
strokes*
And water hazards on the 3rd and 5th holes. That means you can't go to the toilet in that pub or outside between pubs.
And the 6th hole is cloudy, which means you have to do it with your eyes closed.
It is.
You need 9.

Did I mention to you guys I actually bought my girlfriend that "Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics" book?
Also, I'm finally going ot be able to spend some time programming exclusively next week. Bison and finishing that Haskell book huzzah!
It's a "babby's first programming" book for biologists.
First program basically tells you how to use a regex to change a DNA sequence to RNA (just a one letter substitution) but it's handy.
she was pleased. I think she might actually fucking use it.
Also, basically: RNA = DNA =~ 's/T/U/g'
So yeah... I think you can probably see how automation could be really GREAT for biologists.
Especially in comparing DNA sequences, for example.

renjikken: Read "God's Debris"
It's actually pretty interesting and each chapter exponds upon a philosophical idea as a thought experiment.
One such idea is that a perfect being able to do anything would have nothing to do but allow itself to be utterly destroyed and allow the process of transition to a perfect state to occur again.
Hence, God's Debris.
It's also officially available for free as a PDF.

You might also want to check out an excellent piece of work by Poe called "Eureka: A Prose Poem," which I'm to understand was an influence for Scott Adams.
Oh, also, Poe's "Eureka" is where he basically described the Big Bang theory something like 60 years before it was even suggested by scientists.
Poe is one of my favourite authors. If you get time you should really read some of his short stories.
"The Facts in the Case of M. valdemar" is genius.
Never before have I actually felt such a sense of dread while reading a story.
Genuinely chilling.
I have a little edition called "Tales of Mystery and Imagination" that has all the best ones and it's probably only about 4 pounds for such a dainty little hardcover.
Well, you are.
3>he needs his hand held all the time
3>he can't use a system that doesn't work liek Windows
Well, you're either advocating GNOME and KDE or you agree with me.
Which is it?
lrn2linux and we can talk.
The fact that you use an inefficient environment.
Generally speaking, the more a person works with something the more they learn how to do so efficiently.
KDE offers nothing to a person who knows how to use GNU/linux properly.
Preference to work inefficiently, sure.
What's efficient about it?
Nope. KDE uses a ton of resources and if it's going to be worth using *you* need to justify its use of those resources.
You sound liek a Java programmer.
Also, the trade-off of a computer program is to use computer resources in a way that improves the user's interaction.
If you're going to run a program it has to give you an advantage in some way.
Why use KDE when 99% of it is superfluous and you can work without all the bullshit on the back of a 60kB binary?
Preference is an awful answer.
When someone explains their use of somethign as "personal preference" it means they're asking for permission to act illogically.
In a round-about way you're saying, in a socially acceptable way, that your preference is flawed but that it should be respected and can we please drop the subject?
Bad analogy.
Because tasting good is a major part of what you pay for with food.
With KDE you're payign with resources. What do you get?
You're in a cave and I'm Aristotle.
People don't like to be told there's a better way when they're happy with how they currently are.
renjikken: That is Plato's cave allegory.
But the story is about Aristotle.
Benefits of KDE: It "feels" nice for someone who can't/won't learn a more efficient way
Problems of KDE: Actually gives no additional functionality. Bloated.
Tell a lie. It's Socrates.
Another bad analogy and you *know* it is.
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum
Well called, renjikken.
You fix it.
Neither do I.
I couldn't care less who uses my theme.
My way of working with Dark Compact++ has always been to graciously accept bug fixes into the style.
But I'm not fixing shit for other people. I'm not your personal style creator.
Sure, np. Just make your fix and I'll put it on to userstyles.org
A .patch is fine.
You must have me confused with Zixaphir. He's the one desperate for attention and willing to work hard on a style to get it.
I just wanted a style that worked nicely for me and hsared it.
To be fair, redlizard, I couldn't give a fuck if you want to use KDE. It's *not* an efficient or logical way to work, though.
Which it does.
And personal preferences tend to be illogical.
And illogical things tend to be inefficient.
And in this case, the chain is exactly that.
Using a small, lightweight WM has clear, logical advantages.
People who don't know how to use computers liek to point and click. that's why people use GNOME and KDE, Manhose.
They're crutches for the ignorant.
"Tech savvy"
Oh yes, KDE does tend to waste user time.
Like I said, the balancing point is the use of resources for increased user efficiency. You don't seem to be grasping that.
Which you should, if you're approachign this logically.
And again, the burden of proof is on you: What does KDE leverage its use of resources to provide the user besides "taste?"
So nothing, then.
renjikken: If nothing else, a simpler system means less to go wrong. KISS.
If a more complex system offers no interaction advantages then the simpler system is to be prefered.
Manhose: Expand upon this.
And I think a good tool is worth learning to use correctly.
Well, it's nice that the KDE devs are doing charity work.
Except that it is.
Who benefits from user design done for techtards?
Hah. Yes.
GNOME 3 is ridiculously simple...
Manhose confirmed for IQ 80
Except that in many cases making something easy to use initially can become cumbersome as you wish to work without training wheels.
yes, I get it, you believe in a "prefect design."

Are you seriously suggesting that preference over formatting is a reason not to read K&R?
There's nothign wrong with K&R, naosia.
The differences between ANSI C and C99 are nothign to do with formatting.
Except in a few minor places that are still backwards-compatible with ANSI C.
I would also hazard to point out that the vast majority of C compiler don't fully support C99 and you might find yourself looking at somethign that doesn't work correctly with your chosen compiler.
Everything in K&R is fully supported on all platforms by all C compilers.
Yes, auREAXiki. The vast majority are missing at least soem part of C99 compliance.
Noit as part of the standard. It was widely supported, though.
You'll get there eventually.
naosia: read K&R. It's the best C book.
The later standards generally add additional stuff that you cna learn after you've nailed the ANSI basics.

You do understand that later standards are supersets of the older standards starting at ANSi right, Manhose?

Yes.

Also need to do a super simple 2 or 3 line front-end.
Wurt?
I've provided that information in BUFF_SIZE.
No, read knows when it receives an EOF.
So it stops.
And the program continues.
How so?
I'm also looking at making an improved version of the Python thread scraper with download progress meters.
Not sure if it's suitable for the toolbox but thought you guys might like a copy.
FIFO is a means of piping data between programs, chown.
The words "www.4chan.org" get written to a "file" at /tmp/my_fifo
And are instantly read by a program that's "listenign" for input there.
And then the program attempts to download the url given.
I think it siffices to say, Manhose, that it's just a simple way for programs to communicate by sending strings to oneanother.
suffices*
Hey, Manhose: Did you do any work on race conditions when you were handling FIFO?
I have a half a pint of caucasian. :3
We have a site?
When did this happen?
Fucking hell.
usman: You were right to be appauled.
Even a broken link would be better than that.
At least it's decently formatted.
The Python tutorial just seems to be a block of jibberish.
I'm assuming it was just ripped from our old github site.
It doesn't look like a great tutorial anyway. I say we ditch it until we can put up something respectable.

Yeah, absolutely. I can imagine familiarity with the codebase is essential.
Yeah.
I can imagien a lot of programmers aspire to being able to earn that kind of money sitting at home squashing bugs.
It's not even a huge amount of money but you get to work from home and hone your skills, which is a massive bonus.
You wouldn't be interested in earning $20k a month?
Mm. Different strokes for different folks.
I'd work hard for 3 months and then take the rest of the year off.

I don't think "normals" care enough about anything to excel.
Beyond things which I see as somewhat superfluous.
All of my more "ambitious" friends just seem to want to get rich.
But I think that's a big thing. Between "us" and "them."
Motivation. I don't understand how people get so bogged down in things that are very material and short-sighted.
Sure, I'm not saying you have to be totally socially inept, GETOUT.
I go out a lot and I enjoy socialising. I actually have a bit of a reputation for being able to get along with everyone.
But it's very much something I had to learn. i had to read books on bodylanguage because I just didn't "get" it (and still don't, really.)
Everyone has motivation. I just think some people have better motivations than others.
And I think that a lot of people have very short-sighted motivations.

If you wanted art you had to hand-edit the 8-bit binary used to make individual characters in the character set.
And you started runnign out of characters.
So you started having to use your keyboard characters.
And then you had to remember that the bit that looked like the left-hand side of a little house was actually your "x" character and you couldn't use the character "x" in any text any more..
Seriously, renjikken, that's been stuck in my head too.

It was. I called him out on it and then went away for the weekend.
And came back to being told "nah, mang. It's actually not learningcode."
He just wants attention. I actually couldn't care less about him being in the chan until he starts shitting it up.

I think Perl makes for a great first language. I think the biggest complaint from people beginning programming is that "it's nice but what can I actually *DO* with it?"
Perl alleviates that.

auREAX: It's not an ad hominem argument. I'm stating why I won't discuss with nand any more.
Strict standards enforced by a monopoly != standards chosen and accepted by a community
1st on is not freedom. the second on is.
No, nand.
Because you do still have a choice.
You just don't have the freedom to change everyone else's opinion without making a good argument.
You have the freedom to choose, not the freedom to have godly power over what everyone else wants to choose.
Yes, it is.
NO
Because it IS an important difference.
And this conversation is a long, drawn-out and painful affair because *YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT*
NO
Because the community needs to have the power to change the standards as a collective or THEY DON'T HAVE FREEDOM.
A hypothetical problem and outside of the bounds of this discussion, nand.
OK, so, once again I find I've had enough of nand. This kid has an opinion skewed to suit how he currently works with no wriggling room.
I'm out of the conversation and goign to get some lunch.
A word of advice: When you're done arguing with nand you might want to ban him so that you don't have to listen to his willfully ignorant opinions (which he 8will not back down on*) forever.
Because he has some mad cognitive thing where he thinks if he argues long enough he gets to win.

Seriously, though... The way devs are using browsers just reeks of terrible design practise.
A browser shouldn't be an all-in-one mammoth interface.
The shit we do in browsers now should really be handled by native programs.
I just think things like viewing movies etc. should be offline endeavours where you choose the software you wnat to use.
Not Flash-only embedded objects.
It restricts choice of software and that's only ever a bad thing.
And it's a bloated way of looking at things.
But people are despetare to shove everything in a browser so that they can sell you a service.
Which is also bad.

There used to be some seriously dodgy hacking sites in the mid 90s.
No, literally like dodgy "fuck with people who want to be hacker" webrings.

The term "hacker" has connotations of skill, and calling oneself a hacker is very prideful.
I certainly follow the M.I.T. hacker ethic and sympathise very strongly with the culture.
What's the old phrase originally refer to? I can never remember but:
"You're not a hacker until someone else calls you a hacker."
And not some idiot who just sees that you have a terminal up.
Someone who actually knows what they're talking about.

I'd rather use SQL for efficiency.
Manhose: have you actually gone over there?
Good. I want that info.
3>mfw Manhose is on Windows
They published a shitton of UK ATM information but not all of it.
We'd quite like to get ahold of the lot so that we can name-and-shame the shits who charge you money to use their machines.
Shove it all in an SQL database and put together something with Google maps API.
I'm free most of tomorrow. I'm going to do a simple framework.
manhose is in but needs a week, which gives me time ot make the structure of it.
Game.
Basically a bunch of .c and .h files to give a basic idea of the layout, a basic Makefile and a ridiculously simple implementation of the structures.
We could use procedural generation of the maps. I was told you might be interested in that.
Also, yes. C.
I've worked with SDL a bit before, so give me until tomorrow night and I should have something to show you.
Might even be able to get rudamentary movement and gameview drawing, but I won't overcomplicate anything.
We'll literally just be using structs and splitting relevant functions into different .c files like any standard mid-to-large sized C project.
Oh, I'll be going out of my way to write in a way that others can understand. I know I can get a little too carried away with brevity when I'm writing for myself but I also know how to write for others.
We really don't need OOP for this.
KISS.
Once I've done the framework I'll probably focus on the heavy-lifting stuff.
resource management, tightening the bolts on functions for const-correctness etc.
I can imagine nobody will want to handle I/O for saving/loading.
No idea, naosia|phone.
Only saving in town and randomly generating a different dungeon each time would save a lot of complexity.
I know it would be nice to save dungeons and perhaps we could give players the option of re-visiting old dungeons later.
But for simplicity's sake lets just only allow saving in town and generate a different dungeon each time for now.
One town. One dungeon. Unlimited levels down.
Seems simple enough, right?
And it also gives great space for expansion because we can then name the dungeons or theme the dungeons and allow players to pick which one to enter.
But forget that for now. As simple as possible to get it working is what we want.
Also: Selling "warp" items or scrolls or allowing mages to learn a spell to warp back to town would be handy.
Nobody likes retracing their steps.
I don't mind tightening up code.
You're welcome to help out however you can, naosia|phone.
And you're free to look over what we're doing and ask lots of questions. Could be a very good motivator for you to learn.
Yeah, I don't think developing in a million different languages is a good way to KISS.
^
The best projects are ones you could do yourself if the workload weren't so large.
The game we're describign fits that category for me.
Sure.
But you feel like you're getting a TON of shit done if people work together.
Yeah,. that was the first thing we said.
We want to get it working ASAP so that we can all play it!
If we can get random dungeons going up and down, movement and rudamentary combat then we're laughing.
The we add saving, levelling, a shop/items...
Yes, we were discussing that. To start with we were going to ignore classes until we could get a really well put-together design document for them.
Because everyone has great ideas for how to handle classes but we need something that's solid by-the-numbers.
Lets not just do D&D.
AD&D.
Warrior, Wizard, Rogue, Cleric.
And then the advances classes
Ranger, Druid, Paladin, Bard
Sorcerer is more 3rd edition.
But yes. Health and mana.
Starting with those 4 basic classes makes sense.
56th edition D&D? I think you'll find it's 4th.
5th*
It is on 4. yes.
4th
Dual-classing worked fine in 3rd.
I don't play 4th edition.
It's for the WoW crowd.
I didn't really play 3rd either.
We're just talking about pen-and-paper RPGs.
Yes, SDl is simpel enough.
With pixelart graphics.
I'll do some wall templates when I do my really basic stuff tomorrow.

C#: Vala for faggots
Vala uses high-level syntax like C# and compiles down to C, which compiles down to machine code.
It's liek C# but without the corporate faggotry and with the plus side that you can learn C while you're at it if you want.
hey, renjikken.
D has some other stuff as well. I can imagien that the compiler lacks the kind of refinement of C or even c++ compilers, though, due to it's small userbase.
I'd be interested to see what they can do.
D seems an interesting language but sadly falls into the "I already know plenty of other languages that do what D does" syndrome.

Can you or can you not see the source to the .net platform on which you rely?
But not .Net
You can't see the .net libs you link to.

So you can't see the .dlls that C# links to, amirite?
And I'm right in thinking that a great many are not?
And the ones that are link to other .dlls that you can't see the source to>?
At one end or another, when using C# on a platform that isn't Mono, you eventually end up linking to non-free software with closed source.
it's non-free and "closed."
But not all of it.
And not everything it links to.
Still. Better to avoid all that crap and just use a language with a community standard, eh?
auREAXiki: Explain?
ISO and ANSI work for the good of engineers, not for a corporation.
Again: the difference is motivation.
I don't trust Microsoft work in the interest of everyone because a company only works in the interests of itself.
ISO and ANSI are there for the defined purpose of being fair and neutral bodies for determining standards.
Except they're not beyond version 2.0, auREAXiki.
Microsoft have gone from version 2.0 to version 4.0 in the last 6 years and have only done so for themselves rather than through a neutral body.
Java is driven by Sun, whose motivation is questionable.
Sun/oracle, now.

rms is, of course, correct.
He's talking about the difference between positive and negative freedoms.
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Negative_freedom
lrn 2 philosophy of social freedom
Don't know what the difference between positive and negative freedom is? then you shouldn't even BEGIN to criticise rms.
No surprise there.
Close enough.
Your idea of positive liberty is a little off, though.
The two aren't mutually exclusive.
Positive liberty is more about your freedom to affect your own future.
You need both to have a code of laws, yes.
Uh... no.
He has every freedom, still. His starving isn't a social effect.
No, you're totally misunderstanding negative freedom.
ACTION sighs.
Think of class systems.
If you're born into a working class and never given the chance of an education than the society you're living in lacks "negative" liberty laws.
Excuse me. I just confused things.
It lacks *positive* liberty laws.
It's late. Now's perhaps not the best time for this.
Yes.
Positive liberty promotes freedom from interference. not being born into slavery, not being discriminated against because of race or gender.
Except that such a situation is unbalances and descends into a situation where people are no longer treated as equals.
Without codified laws we end up with dictatorships.
OK, so, do we have clear definitions of negative and positive freedom?
Negative freedom: the right to take and own property, the freedom to travel, freedom of speech.
Positive freedom: The right to freedom from people who use the above freedoms ^
So while other people are free to take property it's unfair to allow people to be born into a situation hwerein they will never be able to own property
Where people are free to speak you also need freedom from racial or other abuses or slander
Negative liberty means the de-regulation of business because "it's not fair to restrict enterprising people"
Positive liberty protects the individual from mis-use of accumulated power by said organisations, such as regulations against the formations of monopoly.
So when people talk about the BSD license they're talking about negative liberty -- the right to free enterprise.
When people talk about the GPL they're trying to protect positive freedom.
Ding.
He wants to make sure that people aren't harmed by negative liberties, which is an extremely valid position when you think about the power of the corporations that affect the software environment now.
Yes. that's the difference between the two types of freedom.
like I mentioned before, the BSD crowd equate freedom of choice with real freedom.
Unfortunately, negative freedoms can go to far and we end up with slavery, racism, class-based societies etc.
You can call it "forced" if you want, but it's just a means of ensuring we don't end up with a society divided into suppliers and consumers.
Negative freedoms lead to polatisation.
How would you feel if the only way to write software for a computer would be to work for a big corporation and never write anything but software that restricts peopel and is designed to make money?
polarisation*
Hah. yes.
Now imagine there was only Microsoft allowed to make software.
They'd have no incentive to make good software because they've already managed to destroy all competition.
Well, the point is kindof that companies only really exist to self-perpetuate and make money.
They're machines of industry and nothing more.
Sure. But that's just because the business model is the best one for them to use.
that was going to be my next point.
Once a corporation reaches a certain size it makes critical mass and becomes no more than a set of systems for placing people who will perpetuate the corporation in offices.
perhaps not, but there's one massive difference.
FOSS never has this "critical mass."
it never stops working for the users.
Yeah, that's a bit off topic.
The point is that as a FOSS project grows in size so does independent interest in it.
And the quality only increases.
Once a non-free product has reached critical mass it becomes time to make money from it.
Which almost always means some form of restriction.
Yes, you can make money from FOSS but those restriction-based business models no longer work.
And yet the software continues to improve.
You may think poorly of the quality of FOSS but the honest truth is that under the cheap plastic coating for new users the system itself is great.
because the best software is written by people who want to use it themselves.
So here's the important part:
FOSS works when people actually learn how to use their computers properly.
Fedora is extremely nice, too.
And what happens when FOSS and Windows meet in usability?
^
It almost makes me feel *too* hopeful to think about it.
I just don't see how it can go any other way.
But there's no price difference there.
In fact, people have to go out of their way to get Firefox.
Word of mouth.
You don't remember when browsers cost a shitton of money?
3>mfw I bought netscape in '96 for 60 pounds.
Truth.
And my point is that Firefox is better because it's FOSS that's gained enough momentum.
3>mfw everyone is talking about Cult of the Dead Cow now
So why do you continue to use Windows?
Clearly having experience with FOSS is going to be the big payoff in the future.
What does, redlizard? CotDC or buying Netscape?
I'm under the impression they're still going.
Oblivion. I actually hate Bethesda because of Oblivion.
I hope Bethesda are finally changing their horrible broken system. ;_;
It's not so much the game engine as the stats/levelling system.
Yeah, chown, but does it do so by counting how many times you get hit while wearing heavy armour etc.?
Because that's seriously pants-on-head.
The system's always been broken.
Yes, chown, but the point is that you could end up seriously over- or under- powered depending upon which skills you used and which were tagged as your main skills.
^
Didn't Oblivion level you up based on experience for all of your tagged skills? I can't remember now.
Morrowind did.
Well, anyway, the levelling's fucking stupid and basically getting less character attribute points because you didn't level your skills in a particular way is stupid and unbalancing.
And yes, nand, I think pretty much everyone who played Oblivion used that tactic was a work-around to make sure they weren't gimped.

3>mfw making me install java
Got any screenshots/code instead?
I can look at the code and see what it does?
And see a picture of the maze it generates.
either way, a simple maze algo would be perfect.
If you've already done that then we're flying.
havign said that, would could do more with rooms than a maze.
One problem, though.
At the moment the cell struct has a set of walls attached to it.
i.e. each cell has a variable to determine if it has N, S, E and W walls.
Allows us to do one-directional doors etc.
Yeah.
Would have been nice to just drop that algo in...
Tell you what.
lets just do it as a maze.
fuck rooms.
Or maybe modify it ever-so-slightly to just dump down a room every now and then.
It simplifies the tiles as well.
We can just enumerate OPEN, WALL, etc.
I'll make the changes in the morning.
It also makes handling the drawing of the viewport much much easier...
KISS
This is a much better idea. I was overcomplicating.
Sweet.
I'll change the structs for you to work with ASAP.
Just basically use WALL and FLOOR and add an enum to map.h
May not even need cell objects any more.
OK, do you want to take rejigging the map and cell structs, then? And implementing the maze?
I'll handle the viewport.
We'll need to keep synced, though, because we'll be using the same structs.
If we're lucky we'll end up working in non-overlapping bursts and not step on each others toes too much.
I'm actually pretty busy until the 16th, but I'm pretty excited about this as a project and I'll make time.
I'll also add a simple resource handler before I write the viewport, which will make handlign of resources easy.
I'll just add a simple get_image(char* path) function.
That looks through surfaces that have already been loaded and loads the resource if it's not already in memory.
just to simplify things.
And a get_new_image(char 8path) that overrides that behaviour and loads the image without a check.
Man, that maze algo actually looks pretty cool.
Also, we shoudl add a random chance of a treasure object (or whatveer we use) at each maze end point.
encourages exploration and a bit of level grinding.
yeah, absolutely.
Still. I can see it'll be pretty easy to add logic to create objects at the end of corridors.
Ooh.
recirsive division looks like it would work well for rooms, actually.
Although I still think we should go with a maze style.
Also:
Standard SDL mixer sound or MIDI?
Might as well just use the SDL sound libs.
So you understand what I'm thinking about doing with the cell structs?
i.e. just make them wall or open, basically.
Was just about to say the same thing.
But yeah. If we can basically just do map->cell[10][5]->type
And have "type" be WALL or FLOOR.
Then I can use that in my viewport work to determine what to draw to the screen from knowing party facing and position.

You need to know the basics of how to use those tools before you can build (and re-build) them.
It's like asking someone who's never seen a car to build a car from instructions.
Even if they do it they'll probably not really understand how it works.
And there's a 99.9% chance they'll not do it.
There's also a greatly increased chance that they'll do something wrong.

3>mfw I've been using this system for months
Hah.
Haters gonna hate. I had fun, though.
Sounds like the Microsoft marketing guys got to you, nand.
Sounds like you equate a large codebase to being good.
Simple code and simple design = great tools.
Also, copypaste is correct. dwm can be patched with .diff files to add functionality. More KISS.
You'll never be happy then, nand.
I reached desktop Satori a while back. My computer runs perfectly.
You would seriously rather use the software written by a company (whose motives are suspect) than by yourself or a community of people interested in making great tools to share and improve together?
dwm is <200 lines and you could probably cut that down to 1000 if you knew exactly what you did and didn't want.
Bloat is not power. The more complex a system the more points of failure it has.
Fedora 15 is quite a nice system...
How is the F15 desktop a trainwreck?
Seems fine to me. I ran it from a LiveUSB for the evening and everything worked perfectly.
I even mounted my /home partition and wrote some C.
I think it came with gvim and their Emacs was up-to-date.
nand, I think you're confusing the default setup with the distro.
I couldn't care less about the presentation, It's what's under the default DE that matters.
Although havign said that, I like F15's default setup and GNOME 3 so I still disagree with you on that.
No, nand, because the underlying defaults and repo still matter.
As does the package management and versioning.
Jesus.
OK, back in 30 minutes.
What people want to use != what is good.
You're confusing the fact that Windows and OS X are heavily marketed in a capitalist economy with usability.
3>mf2 my netbook has been on for 2 hours

My girlfriend uses Ubuntu 11.04 and LibreOffice. I use her as my baseline of what a normal person is capable of.

Nope.

Well, the ultimate trump card is this: It doesn't matter if people want to use Linux right now.
It's better for the average user already. It's just going to take some time for people to fucking realise this and the switch-over will snowball.
Seriously considering putting Gentoo on my netbook.
Opinions?
I'd use distcc, copypaste.
Nope, nand.
Look at Os X. Is that painlessly seamless? 
No, it's not.
People like it because it's different and it fixes their issues with Windows.
No fucking pop-up nagware everywhere.
No malware.
Nope, nand. Most of the OS X users are more capable than you give them credit.
many are designers and intelligent young people.
Sure, nand, you do get that kind of person.
I also know a lot of web designers who use Macs.
They may be shit-tier to us but they're still far more tech-savvy than average.
Why, nand?
All that needs to be done is to have a system that works nicely.
OS X does that. Many GNU/Linux distributions do that, too.
Who cares, nand? Marketing can only hold you a market for so long.
Eventually a superior product will win out if it can't be defeated.
PC gaymen is dying.
I think the small minority of people use Windows for games.
A lot of those programs are non-free and actually not very good.
nand: The fun thing about a free market is that eventually  companies will start taking a risk with FOSS systems and do better.
Because Windows is a nightmare to use in a work environment.
And a nightmare to keep secure
And a nightmare to keep up to date
And a nightmare to fix in-house.

Yeah, I have a funny feeling that's the case, too.
I'm just going to be using it to install a bunch of binaries to get things running and then switching over to pure Gentoo anyway.
I need a live medium to unpack the stage 2 and portage snapshot anyway.
Because the liveCD doesn't come with a full set of binaries ot use.
Whereas Sabayon will allow me to install pretty much everything I need as a binary and then slowly switch to a completely source-based distro.
Not really.
Probably not, nand. I'm not feeling particularly anal about it.
I don't often use Gentoo, although I used it exclusively for 2 years between about 2007-2009.
It'll just run nice and light on my netbook. That's all that matters.
Probably something like CFLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=nocona -msse3 -mfpmath=sse -fomit-frame-pointer"

I like *BSD.
If Winfags would stop supporting the non-free shit that breaks compatibility between the POSIX systems it'd actually be viable.
As it is only Linux is able to keep up with the kind of crap those faggots like.

Winfags.
Well done. You're in the .01% of Winfags who con't care about that.
I bet you're a gaymer, though.
You don't like Linux distros but you like FreeBSD? Confirmed for trying too hard.
What are your complaints about GNU/Linux?
inb4 a bunch of stuff that's not improved upon by *BSD.
And *BSD also has the added detriment of allowing the community's hard work to be exploited by giant corporations.
"Too much variety" is ridiculous. The other 2 aren't improved upon by *BSD.
Well, good for you. Your problems with Linux are retarded, though.
But you're free to use a different userland.
So take out the GNU stuff and replace it.
I don't think you know enough abotu the GNu programs to make a decision abotu what's better anyway, though.
And there are several distros that offer alternatived to glibc.
Pedantry.
Why you use Sublime anyway?

nand: Why do you consider the FreeBSD Ports system to be superior to using a package manager?
I also find the conflicting naming of "Ports" to be somewhat of a niggle, seeing as it's used on a mainly-server system.
So you're saying package manager > Ports?
So you use the inferior solution?
You can live with the less tidy, less automated and in pretty much every way inferior system but you can't live with a nice, modern package manager?
You dislike Linux because you *want* to dislike linux for your own reasons.
FreeBSD is aimed at the same demographic.

I'll make some filelr walls so he can see how they have to be laid out.
so that's next on my todo list.
filler graphics, simple drawing to the viewport, algo to work out which walls need to be displayed.
That's my order of work. Should have somethign drawn to the screen by tomorrow night.
Also, I realised that the floor and ceiling can be drawn as a single image.
i.e. a default horizon image that's always used as the viewport's background.
I made some sketches while I was travelling.
Hopefully chown will be able to see what I'm trying to achieve with my filler graphics and make us something nice.

So I don't end up havign to work through diffs.
Manhose: If I want to get the value of a tile on the grid how do I do so?
To determine if it's WALL or FLOOR.
Perfect.
OK, if I get us to the point where we have a basic function ready to draw the viewport and some sample code do you think you could adapt it to properly handle directional drawing?
I'm working on some of the structure of the program and getting an algo to determine what needs to be drawn to the viewport seems like it's going to take a lump of time.
e.g. if I get the function working _but under the assumption that the party is always facing south_ do you think you could take over and make it work with the party's facing?
Also, does anybody know how to edit a project's description in github? I can't seem to find a way.

Esetroot comes with Eterm but is actually a really nice program for setting your "root" window i.e. desktop wallpaper.

Many distros have a separate package for Esetroot because it's a nice stand-alone program.
Yeah. What OS are you using?
I think awesome also has gsetroot
Which is a graphical front-end for Esetroot.
"sudo aptitude install gsetroot" should pull in Esetroot as well.
And then you have a nice wallpaper dialogue for your awesome setup.
Yes, naosia.

ShameOnATrip: BROTIP: ctrl-z pauses a running process.
And you cna use fg or bg to resume it in the foreground or background.
Use keyboard shortcuts?
In pretty much any shell, Manhose.
Handy as fuck.
Als, runnign a program with an "&" afterwards sends it straight to the bg.
Manhose: I've never had any problems.
Programs that handle asynchronous i/o might have a problem but I've never seen it.
Your terminal. Is it 256-color?
"sudo su" and then "echo $TERM"
What system are you running?
You might have to manually patch to get 256 colours.
Unless you're using testing or unstable.
In which case I'm fairly certain the 256-colour version is in the repos.

Just clone the urxvt git and manually apply the patch.
Oh, naosia.
I've got a quick fix for that .bashrc if you want it.
:)
Probably because they want to ensure good service for people using the network for, you know, studying or whatever.
Bandwidth is limited, games create latency and data transfer costs money.
bandwidth != network throughput
Are you talking about the amount of data you can transfer or the speed at which you can do so?
If you have dedicated lines then you're paying the the amount of data being transferred.
Or, rather, youur uni is.
The point is, though, that someone somewhere is paying by the GB.
Which tier is your university's ISP?
PROTIP: It doesn't matter. Tier 3 ISPs pay Tier 2 ISPs by the GB. The best your university can be is a Tier 3 provider for itself.
Otherwise they're leasing from a Tier 3 ISP who are paying by the GB.
np, naosia.
naosia, ShameOnATrip: Shoot.
Then they're paying the Tier 1 by the GB.
Yes, you do.
Unless you're a Tier 1 provider yourself.
Even the Tier 1 providers pay each other for use of each others' networks by the GB.
It's like a great big wrestlign match where you try and make everyone pay for your network access.
dpkg --reconfigure libgl1-nvidia-alternatives ?
Unmetered for *you*, redlizard.
Somebody somewhere is paying for the access cost.
i.e. and the data being transferred.
No idea then, naosia. I'm not on a Debian-based distro right now.
Well, you're free to read up on it, redlizard. If your university has "unmetered" access to the internet and are transferring a lot of data then they could be pressured to reduce the network throughput.
By the company the lease from.
Well, they do.
Also, I'll say it again: bandwidth != throughput.
naosia: Gentoo.
I think it's missing a 32-bit dependency, naosia, at a guess.

Earlier I asked if you could help out with the viewport drawing logic if I started it off.
if I put everything in place and got it working but _under the assumption the party is always facing south_ do you think you could flesh it out with proper use of party facing?
I think you'd have enough information regarding how to do it to extrapolate.
You see what I mean? You'd have all the reference you need to work out how to do it if I provided you with a half-complete version.

GNU+Linux is a perfectly fine way of referring to the operating system.
I believe Stallman was originally very fond of the name "LiGNUx"
In the case of Linux, you need AT THE VERY LEAST some form of libc implementation to interact with it.
And a simple toolchain for creating programs that can interact with the kernel.

Hah.

<3
Lookign at gettign something drawn to the screen finally.
But I'm really not looking forwards to making the logic for drawing the viewport correctly based upon facing.
Which is why I keep pushing for you to take over if I get it half working.
i.e. if I get it working in one direction you would be able to extend that logic to properly use the party's facing.
Oh, I accidentally pushed a typo in the last commit. Fixed with the most recent push. Compiles and runs fine.
I've got the viewport updatign correctly, now. Need to get it drawn to the screen.

Just pushed a commit that now draws the viewport to the screen.
No walls, just a blank horizon. Everythign is in place for the wall-drawing logic, though.
Line 20 of viewport.c onwards WINK WINK NUDGE NUDGE
Oops.
It seems I killed the conversation with my actual coding and want for collaboration...
Also, I'm looking to begin work on a HUD (minimap and compass) and handling keyboard input for movement around the maze (easy once the viewport is drawing correctly).
Oh, and proper handling of a stretched viewport.
Opinions, Manhose?
C, RightLegRed.
You a Pythonista, RightLegRed?
Jesus.
Soudns awful. You could do with some C in your life.
Ack.
K&R C.
~200 pages including standard library reference manual.
Damn you, renjikken. I just omploaded it.
For what it's worth: http://ompldr.org/vMnN5bw
C is a very small, very simple language that can also be surgically efficient. God-tier language.
All it asks is that you understand how a computer stores and handles data.
I've not looked into it extensively, shader, but I have a funny feeling it's fucking brilliant.
I imagine it is to c what Plan 9 is to UNIX.
i.e.: Designed to replace it, filled with brilliant design and great ideas but not practically needed or used.
3>implying C wasn't designed as a high-level language
I do, auREAXiki.
Manhose: You can see why I don't want to do it?
There's a ton more work to be done before we're able to comfortably walk around that maze and I don't want to get hung up on this if I can help it.
Also, you asked for stuff to do and it would be nice to have both of us working on the project.
So far we've both been working in bursts.
And they haven't overlapped.
Honestly, what I'm seeing of Go looks really nice.
It's compiled but offers extremely high-level features (including garbage collection)
But it's not obnoxious in its requirements for a platform like C# or Java and it doesn't have any awful patent worries.
As far as I can tell, anyway.
The BSD license is a niggle.
But FOSS is better than non-free, even if they're not guaranteeing freedom.
3>mfw that's the correct spelling of "guaranteeing"
OK, so, how do you feel about this piece of the TODO list, Manhose?
Because I might crack on to it tomorrow if you don't want it.
No problem.
I'll probably just do it tonight, then.
Yip?
It's no problem, Manhose.
Would be nice to get you involved and properly start to collaborate, though.
Just take some time and look over the code when you can. It's still well under 1000 lines.
We'll talk about it when you have spare time and get you up to speed.
otherwise it'll just get harder and harder for you to join in.
Yeah, Manhose.
But unfortunately we don't really have enough of a project to show to get people interested.
Hence why I want to get us walking around a maze ASAP.
if I can do that and get it really polished then I think people will see the potential of the project.
No, nand.
3>mfw nand has never played a good game in his life
I don't want nand anyway. he's the one person I'd rather do without.
Not a roguelike, shader. A game like the old Might & Magics and Bard's Tale.
Manhose: Will your maze algo always have walls around the edges for definite?
Do you think it would be possible to make that happen? It'd be much easier to work with a maze surrounded entirely by walls.
i.e. We'd never have to check if a cell the party is looking at is actually just the edge of the map and assumed to be wall by your algo.
You get what I mean, manhose?
if my viewport drawing algo is stepping over walls to draw and gets to x:0 or y:0 there shoudl always be a wall to stop it stepping along.
Yes, but wouldn't it actually be easier to alter the maze's algo?
At generation time.
Haven't gotten that fer yet.
if I ask for cell x:0 y:10 it won't always be a wall, right?
But x:-1 y:10 will?
Sweet. Thanks, Manhose.
And anything above the maze's width/height should also return a wall.
Boom.
Yo
I could totally do with it, yes.
But it's fine. The program will basically just segfault if it reaches the map edge for now.
Up to you. I've got enough to work with for now.
But it does need doing at some point and sooner is better.
Why do you need to modify the cell type?
Yeah, it's all yours.
I try not to look at that as much as possible. try to treat it as a black box.
Manhose: You need to install the SDl_image development package.
Man, it's ugly but I'm so close to gettign a working viewport!
Easy fix, Manhose.
Waiting for a push to continue work.
Basically, if you run the program now it'll just show the unstretched viewport with nothing but the horizon background on it.
And a wall on the left if the party should see one there.
It's not a crash.
Any keyboard input currently exits.
Hah.
I'll tell you what, Manhose...
I'm making a hugely inefficient function takign shape, here.
Baws.
I'll get it workign and then you can actually make it good?
Hah.
Alright, I'm done for the night. I'll finish up tomorrow.

Dungeons use that cool old maze algo.

And now he's going to fix the horrific job I've been doing of party_relative_cell_type in party.c
agaric: It's probably about 90% of the way to being a walk-about first person maze.
Which is milestone 1.
No, Manhose. That function's totally broken.
And I need it before I can draw the viewport.
read lines 21 to 28 of party.c
Explains the function's usage.
I just am really hating implementing it. You know when you just can't wrap your head around a piece of logic?
Tell a lie -- it currently works but doesn't make use of the LEFT/CENTRE/RIGHT argument.

C# doesn't force an indentation style.
I still don't think VS enforces an indentation style.

I like any OS except Windows, wave.
I want Haiku so succeed but it really offers nothing to anybody.
What kind of GUI?
I'm assuming you mean a DE or WM.
Write one.
Then stop complaining.
many of us here write their own tools because the existing ones aren't what they want.
If you know enough to undestand the problems with X then you know enough to start writing your own.
Well, then use Windows and stop crying about X.
wave sounds liek learningcode.
Why, Manhose?
Just grab Cygwin and the SDL .dlls.
We'll have to package the Windows version in proper releases, though.
I've got some time during the day to implement it tomorrow, Manhose.
Need ot look up the API for scaling SDl surfaces. Might pre-scale them in the tileset.
So tileset.wall becomes tileset.wall[6] with the index in the array being the distance from the party in cells.
Simples.
Should be easy enough to implement.
You looking forwards to finally being able to walk around in this maze?
Why? Should be easy enough.
Or do you mean after we're walking around?
Hah.
Well, after we're walking around we can have fun designing combat.
Actually, that would be a good project to get people on to.
We need a plan for character stats and some game theory regarding how they will fair against lvl 1 monsters.
chown: There's already a default set up that shows you what we need.

I said it would be simple.
But you get what we need.
Also, "space.png" doesn't need to have that whitespace.
chown looks like such a geek. XD
Wait, is that you, naosia?
No, chown. It's supposed to be 240px in height.
Yeah, I thought that was you, chown.
You big gay geek.
I posted a picture of a photo my girlfriend sent me of her writing Perl.
Which turned into a bit of an unexpected camwhore session.
Yes, I was quite surprised.
Still very simple stuff but she did it all on her own i.e. without my help.
http://ompldr.org/vOWF6cQ
The fact that I was just down the pub one day expecting her to have forgotten about the book and then get sent that picture as a message bodes well.
i don't understand.
Why, when you give a girl a camera, does she instantly try to find ways of taking pictures of herself in various states of undress?
wave: 99% of girls do that.

That's not ugly, bra.
I'd tap that.
Although I assume she's sucking in her belly.

Manhose: You about?
Hey, one[coding]1.
hey, everybody else.
Hey, RightLegRed.
Just put in a couple of hours work on a boring train ride.
Another hour and we should be walking around a maze.
Just updating my github into on my netbook and then I'll push my changes.
Anybody know a higher-quality but slower version of SDL_SoftStretch ?
Manhose: Pull most recent.
Need to make some more changes to draw the right-hand wall but the game's almost ready to start taking input.
I'll finish it up either tonight or tomorrow and then tag it as "ugly but working" and move on to i/o.
Also, I saw Iron Maiden Sunday night and they were serving the beer in 2 pint cups.
http://ompldr.org/vOW16cA
Sheffield.
Hey, I've got to shoot out.
Tell me all about your Sheffield experiences when I get back.
Manhose: Got a movie night with a pal but we'll be moving about that map by this time tomorrow.
I've also got some personal niggles about data structures being used that I want to fix.
Catch you all in a bit, guys.
Manhose: The scaling we're currently using is the built-in "fast" scaling.
Which isn't really what we want.
I might have to write an algo to block the pixels better and make it look neater and more retro.
But again, I can only write one thing at a time.
And the logic for rendering the right-hand wall still isn't done.
Also, hey everybody.
'sup, xiaobai?
Any interesting projects on the go?
What's up, naosia?
It's 2d.
I think Manhose would like us to explore the idea of working with 3d, which I'm not wholly against, but I'd much rather get something working first and then (if necessary) do a big redesign.
Than chop and change direction early on.
xiaobai: language?
?
naosia: Nope.
TRACER T
Yo, Manhose.
naosia: Many routers lump in attempts to access many ports in rapid succession with DoS.
Manhose: It's on the to-do list.
That current scaling function is designed to be used in real-time and is very low quality.
We don't need real-time. The viewport is only updated when the party moves.
So a more intensive algo would be very helpful.
We might also consider maintaining aspect ratio and only scaling in integer amounts.
I just wanted to get it working so that you could decide to jump in if you wanted to.
Finishing up getting that right wall displaying properly is a 30 minutes job and simple movement should be another 30.
chown: Write us a pretty SDL scaling function?
Not a problem, Manhose.
I'm pretty burnt out today, too.
SDl stores surfaces in a 1-dimensional array.
OK, dude.
If anybodyt tries to fob you off with SDL_SoftStretch then ignore it.
We want better quality at the expense of processing time.
Looks good, Manhose.
Ideally we just want to gut out the function we want and ignore the rest.
Definitely don't want to have extra deps.
I can't step up my hostility towards nand any more than it currently is.
Which is pretty much "kill on sight."
But I would if I could.
As far as I'm concerned being nand is a kickbannable offense.
I did notice.
chown: Like what?
Do you do a whole lot of campaigning and stuff, chown?
A bunch of my girlfriend's housemates get really politically active about gay rights and the like and I tend to get them upset by not really caring.
I mean... they don't need to convice me. I already think they should have all the same rights as anybody else.
And a lot of their campaigning feels like teen drama.
And I actually think it really hurts their credibility when they go that route.
Hey, Manhose.
I'm already pro-gay marriage. I'm not really sure what other rights the LGBT community lacks.
Probably Monday, Manhose. I have a day off tomorrow, the girlfriend's comign down to arrange moving Friday followed by a friend's birthday do. I have a gig Saturday and I'm planning ot be very hungover Sunday and sell a bunch of my stuff on ebay.
chown: I agree. let people have their partnerships and without religion.
np, Manhose.
I've probably put in abotu 5-6 hours the last few days to do most of the "worky" stuff and I have some fun stuff lined up for Monday.
Like the HUD.
Also, taking submissions on ideas for how to handle the combat system.
And a couple of the guys have expressed interest in coding.
Straight people can have civil partnerships in the U.k. ...
Commonlaw marriage.
Religion has no place in government.
And no place in determining who can form partnerships.
That's the same thing, Manhose.
Yes, we have secular marriage as well.
but gay peopel still can't do that, I believe.
Because LAWL GOD INVENTED MARRIAGE
Marriage: Copyright GOD
I also have somewhat of an issue with feminism.
To the degree that every feminist I know plays the victime ALL THE FUCKING TIME.
I've had this conversation with a whole group of feminists before.
We needed feminism in the 60s and 70s and it did its job.
I'm an advocate of gender equality and calling yourself a feminish implies that women still need a movement to help them because men are all just a bunch of oppressive pigs.
Women basically have equality here.
Wages are still a little off but that takes time to work out.
And, to be fair, many women drop out of the high-career world to have children. Which is their choice.
Manhose: You don't get equal treatment from a society by playing the victim. You do it by earning respect over time and showing yourself to be capable.
Society has changed to accept that we no longer live in a "women raise the kids and men work in the mines" type of society but these things happen gradually.
Later, naosia.
I'm fine with affirmative action is it assists that balance being found quicker.
But while it balances things quicker inthe eyes of the law it can actually make things worse socially.
Take it easy, naosia.
Manhose: Scarface, Once Upon A Time In America or Dr Strangelove for my late-night movie viewing?
I love it, too.
Fuck it, I'm gonna watch that.
... grinders?
Oh, OK.
No, not really.
Nah, that's not my kind of movie.
I'm actually a bit picky with my movie tastes. I like really cerebral cinema and find most other things quite boring.
Primer is one of my favourite movies of all time, for example.
And I spammed it all over /g/ a few years back.
Scarface is brilliant for a whole bunch of reasons.
One of which it the mountains of coke all over the place.
Man, I'm trying ot think of the name of this movie I saw...
I made a bunch of people watch Pulp Fiction recently.
Extremely disappointed and my girlfriend's student friends and their lack of movie experience.
Especially the GF.
In the last few weeks I've made her watch Robocop 1+2, Starship Troopers, Jackie Brown, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, Braveheart, Dusk Till Dawn...

Outdated and just a rebranding, basically.
With claims that it's "faster and more secure."
And what extensions are in SRWare Iron?

Yes, I also asked for the platform it was compiled on, the compiler used and build options so that I could verify that the source builds to match his binary.

c-c-c-c-c-combo breaker
Sorry, couldn't help myself.
What's up, Manhose?
Looks fine to me, Manhose. It's effectively what's already written.
Look at dungeon.c
The input handling funtions returns a GAMESTATE. If that gamestate is anythign but RUNNINg then it drops out into the main loop in dungeon.c to switch to a different game state.
Ahhh.
I don't have any really big preference regarding how input or gamestates are handled. If you have a good idea of how to work it then feel free to implement.
I literally just bashed out something super quick and then ended up adding to it later out of convenience.

How are they claiming to be FOSS and then selling licenses? That doesn't make any sense.

Hey, renjikken.
The number of people using ssh who fail at security is unbeleivable...
Allosing root logins... Allowing password authentication...
Allowing root logins is just what it says: Allowing remote users to attempt to log in as root.
Which means they already have a username to try and if they manage to get the password they have complete control of your system. Which is insane.
Password authentication literally means letting you log in with your user's password. This is nowhere near as secure as using a public/private key pair.

Well... Oracle *are* a bunch of dicks...
one[coding]: Feel free to go read your celebrity gossip papers instead, then.
Slashdot is my favourite source of tech news because it's updated all day every day and is dense with information.
"news will find me" isn't a great way of ensuring that you're informed.
I guess that's a cool stance to have or whatever.
But I like to be politically active and that means being informed.
Discussing politics is the most important part of politics.
In a democracy our freedoms are always slipping. Informing yourself and informing others is the most important step in ensuring democracy continues and that corporate lobbying doesn't lead us to a corrupt government.
Yes.
Especially in America. Those guys are FUCKED.
And information regarding such things is rife on Slashdot.
The MPAA paid $111 Million to Obama's election campaign, for example.
And now we have the American government shitting all over "consumers" doing the MPAA favours.

A friend of mine died in January and we put together a festival for him.
And now the venue's announced it's closing down 3 days before the event.
So now we're venueless.
http://www.itv.com/anglia/charity-festival-letdown61727/
What are you intending to do with it?
Because your hardware capabilities are 99% of what software you choose.
So you'll be running it on a general purpose computer?
Don't even look at an embedded OS, then.
You may as well just use Linux and go LFS.
I really don't think you'd be happy using an embedded dev board.
But there are some nice RISC system boards going about.
And that 20 PC is entering alpha production.
Poundsymbol 20
Looking for a link now.
Do you not remember the news about the $20 PC?
Raspberry Pi, it's called.
Alpha release is being manufactured now.
I think that's saying Q4 full production.

I've probably got another half hour in me.
Have you got any thoughts on character stats? Manhose is looking at making character/party and inventory screens.
And I was going to just dump in some basic opposed stats.
I'd rather use classes.
Which is odd, because in P&P roleplaying I hate classes.
but this seems like the easier way to design.
Sweet.
I don't need anything like that until the weekend but I think Manhose can jump right into the character sheet stuff right away.
Not sure when he can start, though.
Great stuff, man.
Sounds simple enough.
Although this doesn't really leave a space for your opposition to be good at avoiding blows.
I also am concerned about scalability.
We don't want to have an arbitrary cap on level limit, for example, so the maths should scale reasonably well.
OK, the other things is that you don't really have to think in terms of dice any more.
Because we can do a d1897 just as easily as a d20.
Ah, now this is an idea I liked.
Each 1 by which you succeed on an attack adds 1 to damage.
And then you make, say, a STR vs. TOU roll and the amount by which you succeed does 2 * that amount damage.
It's a pretty simple language, yes.
I was taking a dump.
Deal w/ it, nerd.
pascal is the most awfully over-complex language of all time.
Learning it must be some kind of nightmarish hell for programmers.
No, that's what I actually think of Pascal.
I thought you were talking about pickle.
Before.
I'm not even mad. 
Just disappointed.
I thought you were better than that.

Yes.
I might even go so far as to say it's simpler than C.
Nah.

It's easy enough to change the party struct if we want to change things.
So long as you don't delve too deeply into implementing the character/combat system we'll be fine.
Yers, I know what you mean.
But we don't need pop-up dialogues or anything. We literally just need to show the icons. We can implement items properly later.
Just assume every type of item has an image to display and go from there.
Why are you trying to deal with shit like that? We don't even have a proper health system.
Just accept that the item has an image and draw it. Don't delve too quickly too deeply like the dwarves of Moria.

Although I've never properly attended.

one[coding]: Weed is for losers. ;_;
Sorry, bro. I just don't like the weed culture.
Maybe it's different over there, but it's pretty much just the real losers in England who do weed.
Everybody who's worth talking to is on some form of uppers.
Having said that, I like salvia.
Hallucinogenics are fun fun fun.
I don't really enjoy just feeling heavy and unmotivated.
My sister's been a real hippy for a long, long time. Like... probably since before a bunch of you were born.
And she used to do us some great mushroom tea.
I think my main problem with weed is the "chasing the dragon" effect.
I just don't enjoy it like I did 18 years ago.
Plus I had a really big coke thing in my early 20s.
Which was fucking AWESOME.
chasing the dragon = tryign to have a good time like the first time you did it.
But it's never as good the 2nd time.
And the 3rd time's never as good as the 2nd.
etc. etc.
My first weed experience was in highschool.
Getting stoned in a field with my at-the-time girlfriend.
Was awesome.
And my best friend who's still my best friend to this day.
Who's actually a school teacher now.
But no -- of all the things I've tried in my time the first time was the best.
So if somebody gives you something you've never had before make sure you're ready to have a fucking good time.
Because you'll never do better than that time with the same substance.

If I remember correectly.
I was ~6 when they showed me this.
naosia: It's a near miss at ~1:16
Actually filmed with no special effects.
Literally a kid almost being run over by a bulldozer.
I actually think that's scarier to watch as an adult.
What fucking dickhead thought that was alright to film?

List of kids who got killed in gruesome ways on farms
bahahahaha
The compilation is funny as fuck.
the awful screams over the ending.
So funny to think that they showed us that stuff at school.
naosia: I think it hit him in the head.
If you look at the bit at the end I think it lists a kid who's killed by a metal rack full of tools.
I think they're supposed to be representations of how kids actually died.
Which makes it worse if anything.
I'm playign a festival at the beginning of August.

I'll have a look for them tomorrow.
Or I'll take ap icture of the scar or something.
It was a broken bottle, actually.
Imagine putting your hands up to stop yourself being stabbed.
Went in my left hand down into my arm.
Big bit of glass broke off.
Fell down, passed out. Woke up surrounded by people.
Went to get up in my confusion when I wouke up. Blood sprayed fucking EVERYWHERE.
It was a nasty one.
They dumped me in a ambulance and I had to wait in hospital to be stitched up.
Got out at ~8am.
Walked to work. Told them I was fucked basically.
they got the glass out at ~5am.
And stitched me up.
Most painful stitches I've ever had.
I've got a giant scar on my left leg where I had a piece of glass through it and out of the other side which is also a long story.
it was more painful than that.
your hands are really fucking sensitive. Especially yoru wrists.
Yeah, they used a local anesthetic. It still hurt a fuckton, though.
I think they were worried about mixing the anesthetic and the huge amounts of alcohol I'd had.
On your head?
Bawhawhawhawhawhaw
Sounds stupid.
When I was a kid I had a huge piece of glass smashed through my leg. Doctors told my family I'd never walk, basically.
Doctors don't know shit. I walk fine although I do noticably favour my right leg if you know to look for it.
Bawhawhawhawhaw
Manhose's stories are all bitch injuries.
Man, I tell some great stories when I'm drinking with people.
I told my now-infamous "golf ball story" all the time. Even told it at a comedy night once.
it's much better in person, mang.
But there;'s a series of porn movies called "Anal Acrobats"
Girls shoving stuff up eash other's arses and pushing them out, basically.
And I had a super kinky girlfriend at the time.
And all my fridns knew her. Just turned 18 and totally DTF all the time.
And I convinced her to do some of the stuff in these movies.
And my bro had bought me this golf set thing for my birthday. A golf tee, a golf ball and a hip flask.
DOWN TO FUUUUCCCKKK
So yeah. I put the golfball up her arse.
But in the movies they pretty much just put it up there and push it out again.
The hip flask had to be thrown away. It was causing me problems.
But yeah. I basically put this golfball in and sdmashed it up with the force of a thousand exploding suns.
Possibly the best sex anybody's ever had ever.
And then afterwards she's, like, "I can't get it out."
So I told her to just go chill out in the bathroom and just let nature take iut's course.
Everything flows in the right direction eventually, right?
But yeah. She came back and she was a bit panicky and we looked on the internet.
And they basically said stuff goes up this whole other chamber.
And your guts sort of grab on to it and tear and blood and all kinds of awful-bad stuff.
So I was, like, "OK, lets order a pizza and chill out for a bit and then if we've not had any luck we really need to go to the hospital."
And now's a good time to point out we'd already been to the hospital for some embarrassing sex stuff the week before and she really didn't want to go again.
So yeah. Pizza comes and nothing's happening. Things are fucking dire.
So I'm, like, "FUCK THIS I'M GOPING TO HAVE ONE MORE GO"
And all we've got is this mad tingly lube.
So I lube my hand up and she's on her back with her legs in the air.
We'll come back to that.
And at the time I was living with my little sister who's in the next room in her bedroom.
And this bitch is fucking SCREAMING and I'm up to my thumb in her arse looking for this ball.
And I can feel it with my fingers but I can't get ahold of it.
And I'm, like, "I'm going to have to put my thumb in as well. I've almost got it! We're almost home free!"
So I put my fucking thumb in and I'm way past my wrist in this girl's guts and I'm pulling this ball out of her.
And I fuck you not, I'm fucking concentrating so hard trying to do this.
And I pull this ball out of her that's been blocking her up for 2 hours and it's covered in this black, tar-like shit.
And what I can only possibly describe as a fart volcano just sprays all in my face.
UNBELIEVABLE
I still have the ball.
This girl was fucking ridiculously hot, too.
Hang on. I might have a pic of her.
We broke up on really bad terms (as you might imagine) and she blocked me on Facebook.
But she sent me some nudes which I might still have.
We broke up because I beat up her ex.
He was a little shit. Phoned her on new years eve when I was pissed up and was just generally being far too familiar with her.
So I told him to come be a man about it.
Turned up with his mate. Smashed 'em up with my front door keys.
Like a goddamn BAWS.
Sorry, it's not very good quality.

You put your keys through your fingers and punch with them, RightLegRed.
Also, that Marshall half-stack is my goddamn pride and joy.
Yeah, she's hot as fuck.
Yup.
It is a combo, but it's basically the 250W of a stack with the amp head in it.
I have another 250W half now, which is basically a full stack.

The one constant thing in all of your failed relationships is you, after all.
Naw, it'll just take you some time.
I miss a whole bunch of my ex girlfriends. Even the awful ones that totally didn't work at all.
Mm. You're young.
TBH I also believe that the older you get the more jaded you get.
And that's not particularly a bad thing.
Bitches seem to love that I don't care.
hah.
I honestly think when you're 18 you're genuinely, like, "Man, I'm not like those guys who treat girls like shit."
And then the more time goes on the more you're, like, "Oh, fuck 'em. They're hassle."
Fuck it. I'd rather be too old to be having the kind of fun I'm having than young and overly responsible.
It is, to a degree.
Maybe also, to a degree, it's more about having actual shit to reminisce about.
When was the last time you made a bad decision?
When was the last time you actually made a really *important* decision?
The reality is that you actually have to make a fucking *ton* of bad decisions before you're responsible enough to care about those decisions.
HAH

Too late. I did it anyway.

At the same time, I had a fairly serious conversation with my girlfriend the other day.
"YO JOHNSON," she said
"Do you really feel like you're giving up a load of your freedom if you move in with me?"
PROTIP: Never say yes.
She's all upset.
Seriously, though, you really are giving up a ton of freedom if you move in with a girl.
And she's pretty good about accepting that I don't want a clingy girlfriend.

She's 21 in September, so not long.
i get along well with her parents, surprisingly.
She's traditionally had a string of loser-ish boyfriends that don't talk to people or, apparently, have fun.
And like I said, I met them at a show.
There's a gap. I don't find it to be a problem, though.

Yes, absolutely. If it's not right I'll make a quick write-up of some basics I have an idea about and we'll use that instead.
And work from there.
Things like that his mechanics didn't seem to have an mechanic of opposition for attack rolls and scalability seemed like it might be a problem.

And being a jobber.
And Japanese deathmatches.
I have done.
The second book is more "me and my buds" funny stories.
Most of which is Mick on the road with the big federations and having fun with other big-name wrestlers.

man, I have too many books to read.
I think I'm going to go get to work on that in a minute.
A collection of Arthur C. Clarke's short stories, William Gibson's Burning Chrome, a collection of Lovecraft's works, The Baroque Cycle
I like collections of well-known author's shorter works because I can read them in short bursts.
Yes, Ohnana.
Facebook fan of that, twee_.
one[coding]: My only criticism of H.P. Lovecraft is that he can't finish his stories for SHIT.
Lovecraft is like Poe + Massive awesome mythos - ability to end a story well.
He can be, twee_.
Poe may be my favourite author of all time.
Up there with Neal Stephenson.
I've actually found that if you're selective Dean Koontz is a very good author.
For a slightly more mainstream horror.
What, you want a scary book suggestion, twee_?
one[coding]: What do you think would be a good Lovecraft story to start with?
I'd rather recommend Lovecraft than Koontz.
Hang on, let me grab my "Necronomicon."
And I'll look for a short story for you.
Alternatively, Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue is excellent.
You know that story was made into a game, twee_?
For anybody that wants a great short Sci-Fi story to read you should pick up Arthur C. Clarke's "Childhood's End."
It's fucking BRILLIANT.

"THEY look like jerks!"
I recommended games?
Man, my memory is AWFUL.
FUCK YEAH
PROTIP: If you install BG1 & 2 you can then use BGTutu to play BG 1 in the BG 2 engine, which is much better.
Also, Manhose, it's perfectly fine to play BG 2 and then realise that you wish you'd played #1 more and start again.
I say just draw a cock and then write on top of it "IT'S A COMPUTER THAT COSTS 20 POUNDS WE DON'T NEED A GOOD LOGO BITCH"
Obviously the downside is that you'd need a different logo for each currency.
It's a little smoother and with some more character creation options, Manhose.
Sorceror, Barbarian and Monk come in as well as 3 specialist classes for each pre-existing class.
So instead of being a flat fighter you can roll up a berserker, wizard-slayer or kensai.
You should also get the widescreen hack if you play for any considerable amount of time.

Apparently a huge part of the rioting in the U.K. is being organised over Blackberry IM.
Blackberry are handing over messages to police.

I always thought I was fairly lax with wording...
Manhose: My main problem is that it can be arbitrarily used against genuine protesters, for example.
There are certain laws that go a bit too far in both the U.K. and U.S. that allow police to hold people without charge.
But that's my point, Manhose.
It's not up to Blackberry to decide who's right or wrong in a protest.

Oh, you didn't answer me yesterday, Manhose.
Do you have any uncommitteed changes to dungeon?
i.e. inventory stuff.
OK.
I'll wait until you do that, then.
I want to avoid manual merges as much as possible.
Well, which files will you be intending to modify?
OK.
OK, we'll probably only conflict on game.c anyway.
And there'll barely be any overlap.
Hrm.

Oh wait, yes.
Well, lets see what you come up with and we can fix the situation of having two handlers.
It should be easy enough to merge them.
What was the point, then?
Program better, then.
Bawhawhawhaw
Seriously, though, it sdhould be just one piece of code in game.c
Maybe 2 if you're talking about a subhandler.
That's fine.
The GAMESTATE system needs some work. Those two pieces of code should be merged at some point.

yeah, I've been wondering where he is for the last few days, too.
Who said that?
He *is* very desperate to be seen as useful.
I like GETOUT but he's been very needy at times.
You know when somebody is constantly making reference to their own skills in an attempt to make people pay attention?
Bah. I don't want to rag on him. I like GETOUT.
But he did spend the first few days here repeatedly saying "But, then, I'm a lisper!"
To his credit, though, he does know his Lisp reasonably well.
And to a lesser degree Haskell.
It's handy having a functional programming bro around.
I also question what makes a person on IRC "useful."
TBH I get all of my information from books or t'internet.
Relying on IRCbros for useful information is a recipe for disaster.

naosia: Does the archiver figure out thumbnails correctly?
i.e. duplicates.
You might be able to save some space with symlinks.
Oh, actually I just found the thread you posted in.
And somebody already asked that.
So nvm.
is the code available to look at?
Jesus.
The archive is using unmodified code?
Checking out a read-only version of the code to see if there's anything I can do to help with reducing the amount of space used by thumbnails.
Where's the scraper module?
Got it.
300 lines of barely-readable Perl.
This should be easy.
No, there's no facility to remove duplicates.
Although havign said that it doesn't need to be part of the core functionality.
We already have a dupe checked in the toolbox. You just need to modify it to replace duplicates with symlinks.

renjikken: Do you know xlib?
You should try setting your wallpaper with xsetroot to determine if you do need to draw to the root window or not.
Or Esetroot if you have it.
Just do soemthing like "xsetroot -solid black"
You don't need to do anything complex. Just make a program that draws directly to the root window.

if target.hp < 1: return
And then just do the rest of the logic afterwards.
Also, what's the problem with the code?
so you want to use arg handling?
There's an import for that, although I can't remember it.
Hang on, I think I used it in an old project.
Yeah, there's a module called getopts you can import.
If I understand you correctly.
Wait.
You're talking about your constructor, aren't you?
Hrm. In C what you're talking about is a function pointer.
But my Python is limp-along-when-you-need-to-use-it level at best.
check out dictionaries with keys.
basically you have a list of any type and you go dictionary[key]
I'm fairly certain you should be abel to apply a dictionary to functions.
Personally I'd just dump a big, ugly if blah: attackfunc = thisfunction elif blah blah: attackfunc = otherfunction. etc.
Although I'd rather pass a function pointer to the constructor and do it that way.
And then just do a safety clause in the constructor of if (!infunc) { attackfunc = defaultattack; } or whatever.

I'll try most any language so long as it isn't impeded by political issues.
And I don't have a problem with C++, I just think it's unwieldy.
There's no reason not to be able to nail C.
It's a tiny language.
With a tiny standard lib.
And yes, lingua franca.
Libs.
And just pretty much any simple program you want to do right.

naosia: Sorry, I stepped away for a second.
Use uniq.
And wc
You may have to split out the IPs first if they're in a table, also.
But basically if you just have a document with a bunch of entries you can use uniq to remove duplicates.
So you would do "cat access.log | uniq" and that would show all the unique IP addresses.
And "cat access.log | uniq | wc" would tell yo uthe number.

You have ot excuse my ignorance of modern BASICS -- I haven't use a BASIC since probably the early 90s.
Do you still gosub etc?
gosub+return
It doesn't even sound like BASIC.
Never used QBasic, as far as I can remember. certainly not for any considerable amount of time.
But what does it offer over C/C++ ?
I'd rather use an established language and improve my useful skillset, you know?
hah. Well, soudns liek fun anyway.
But I just know that if I was on github looking for software to use or projects to work on I'd not even look twice at a QuickBASIC one.
Or freeBASIC.
But not badeless bias.

Hey, Wizbro.
Hey, RolandTG.
No. We've gotten very lazy.
Manhose is handling an inventory implementation, which we really need.
But he's gone away for the weekend.
And I've still just got to put the polish on the walkaround code.
Hrm.
Can't even find anything about it in the Xlib manual.
ulong32
Are you working with xcb?
It's a programmer-assigned value?
Not something that's returned by the lib, for example?
Kindof an internally-handled thing?
I would imagine there are no set values, then, as Xlib uses the value internally to determine which layers are where.
Yes.
So it's an arbitrary value.
So there won't be any list of specific bit values.
Makes sense to me.

If you're getting spam your account is probably also on a list of accounts being attacked as the next potential spambases.

Cloud-based IDE?
It's an awful idea.
Dumping everything into a browser is the reason all our modern browsers are slow bloated bullshit.
Relying upon others to look after our shit for us and provide us services that we can provide ourselves is why we have no privacy.
I just... can nobody else see this?
Bad design + bad policy fuckign everywhere.
But it doesn't matter.
Even with the privacy aside editing shit in your browser is a bad idea.
I mean, fuck, your browser is probably the most easily exploited piece of software on your computer.
More complexity = more bugs = more security holes = worse software.

Although I think they actually go out of their way to be clear about the rights to redistribute AND redistribute modifed versions
And put examine/modify together.
I have a funny feeling the "redistribute (un)modified copies" clarity thing is because of pieces of software like Firefox.
Where they're a bit funny about terms under which you can redistribute it.

Also, thanks for the link TSwift.

Although admittedly the computers I've always worked with have had some form of scripting language or interpreter to interact with them.

And herein lies the problem: No default shell to interact with computers == Incompetent computer users.
learnig nt ouse your shell has marked benefits.
learning to use*
And teaches you programmign basics.
Manhose: Yes or no - do you think you would be better at using a computer if your computer came with a big button on the desktop for switching to the terminal?
Bah.
Curiosity.
I didn't need ot learn to program to use my BBC Micro.
But it made my computer work better for me. It game me more control over the functionality of my tools.
I've always enjoyed that and I always will.
I'd just like to see people encouraged to use the terminal more.
Manhose: You know some ASM and the Linux API, right?
Did you go out of your way to memorise the syscall instruction values or do you just use a reference?
I also find remembering the registers you can push arguments to very difficult for IA32.
EAX EBX ECX EDX ESI EDI EPB
wat
i.e. the instruction value to execute.
Like 0x80 for exit.
Is the only one I can remember off of the top of my head.
It just feels like there's too much to IA32 ASm to memorise.
And that the register names are... unhelpful.
Looks like I'm going to have to.
maybe I'll pick it up in time but I don't normally touch IA32 ASM.
Oh, hey, this is actually helpful.
Now I just need one for the Linux syscalls and I'll be sorted.
Oh, ffs. 0x80 isn't even exit. It's switching to kernel mode.
This ^ is exactly what I mean.
So: mov eax, 0x1 / int 0x80
Executes the exit syscall.
Only pen & paper work with the document RolandTG gave me to see if I can make a theoretically sound system.
I feel we need to account for opposition. Currently we're working on a "each +1 adds a 5% chance to hit" without any opposition.
Which obviously doesn't scale.
And doesn't account for how hard your opponent is to hit.
I have some ideas. I'm going to send a document back to RolandTG with my proposed changes and then start to implement.
Then hopefully he'll come up with some clever ideas I didn't see and can actually get stuck into the meat of it. like classes.

And the idea of the toolbox is to have small scripts with clear functionality.
Not I.
Sure.
I'm probably going to merge in a bunch of the small fixes but not the big helpers script.
Going through it now.
Elaborate?
But that large, lumped together file of functionality isn't in fitting with the toolbox.
Yeah. The idea is to provide small scripts that have functional and learning value for new programmers.
^^
This isn't the first time someone with good intentions has written a large script for the toolbox.
Maybe we should start a secondary repo for cool tools that are helpful but not in fitting with the toolbox.
ShanaLover: Proposed changes?
Also, have you and naosia worked out your differences? Last I heard you were b& from the chan.
Well, the other point of the toolbox is to provide identical functionality in multiple languages.
So that a Ruby programmer, for example, could look at the Ruby script and then the Python script and see how the 2 differ.
You're free to make changes to make the script more "Python-ish" and efficient, ShanaLover.
the input should be black-box style, however -- all programs should take the same flags.
So don't add mroe flags.
Yup.
Needs to be documented.
Shotgun not.
Boom.
OK, so, if you drop the helpers.py file from your branch, ShanaLover, we can merge it.
Saves me the trouble of branch, checkout, diff, cherry-pick, push.

I grabbed the Art of Exploitation LiveCD from inside the back cover.
Totally broken version of Ubuntu from 2007.
Horrible bright green and bright blue theme.
I just thoguth I'd skim the first few chapters.
REALLY basic stuff but the kind of things I think everybody should know.
It covers C and ASM in some detail, for example.
but just the real basics.
But in such a way that I think even my girlfriend and non-techie friends would get it.
So far it reads like a "stop your friends being incompetent" book.
The Shellcoder's handbook expects you to know some C and ASM from the get-go.
the first chapter is basically "You should understand this shit." followed by "if you don't understand this shit this is where you can learn."
I mean The Art of Hacking literally babby steps you through pseudo-code bringing you closer and closer to actual C.
It really doesn't expect you to know *ANYTHING*.
The first 20 pages are basically the basics of C syntax.
while and for loops.
if-else statements
functions.
And I actually think it does a reasonably good job.

copypaste: Go for it.
man perl
Hah.
perldoc is also your friend.
perldoc perldoc
naosia: No.
Chroot from your current GNU+Linux install.
naosia: Using the Gentoo LiveCd is just a means to have a Linux environment to install from. Chrooting is how you actually do the installation and you can do that comfortably from where you are.
copypaste: It's very powerful and flexible. Great for hacks.
Basically allows you to have a shell in a different root location.
So if you have your space reserved for Gentoo mounted at /mnt/sda3 and you've unpacked your tarballs there...
You then just "chroot /mnt/sda3" and you're working withing your Gentoo environment.
You also need a few other commands to make things cosy. It's all in the handbook.
copypaste: What are your reasons for wanting to pick up Perl, anyway? What languages do you know already?
Because I basically just treated you as a fairly competent programmer by telling you about "perldoc perldoc" but i can't remember off the top of my head what you actually know.
Ah, good. That's a godo reason to learn.
Never try to learn a language without having a practical use for it.
naosia: Your default USe flags are kept in /etc/make.conf
And you can emerge with customn ones like this (but it's not recommended):
sudo USE="gtk" emerge vim
the only reason you'd really do that is with oneshot installs. Adding --oneshot as a flag basically tells emerge not to update that package automatically.

Up to you.
If I'm going to zero-zill I normall install everything first and then zero-fill the remaining space.
Literally just dd from /dev/zero to a file on the filesystem you want to mess with.
so to zero-fill your root partition literally just do "dd if=/dev/zero of=/zero.fill"
Doesn't erase everything from your partition tables, though, so z full zero-fill is the security conscious person's method of choice.

renjikken and redlizard are correct.
fgets allows you to specify a maximum input.
Otherwise it's possible to start writing over the stack.
Also, fflush(stdin) is your friend.
And, to elaborate, writing over the stack is how you write over the eip register and that's how you hijack control of a program's execution.
Classic off-by-one error.
havign said that, I haven't even looked at the source yet.
I'll grab it now just out of curiosity, even though it sounds like this is all sorted.
renjikken: read chapter 0x200 of Hacking: The Art Of Exploitation.
it won't help you with your character handling stuff but it covers the basics of using a debugger to fix any rpoblems you have.
auREAX: it'#s alright. I'm not into anything that I don't already know yet, but the style has me optimistic that when I get to the parts I want to learn it will be well explained.
Something like ~130 pages in.
Gah
It's essential knowledge.
Hrm.
Rule 110 is best handled with binary logic...
renjikken: Are you about? Would you be interested in seeing how I would have handled the logic in the value_at function?
OK, np. Maybe later, then.
I'll show you the hack I came up with for figuring out the result of rule110.
Using binary logic.
Merging what?
Oh, I don't use mercurial except for pulling.
Vim + Fugitive.vim for git, though.
Makes merges 1,000,000x easier.
:%!fold
Oops.
Keep fucking doing that. Sleep deprivation.
Me, one[coding] and I believe DukeDerpington__ pulled all-nighters together the other night.
In an attempt to fix our sleep.
Spent a few hours talking about neo-Nazi parties/the BNP and watching YouTube videos.
And I fell asleep on the sofa at midday the next day.
Anybody care to do a code review on my pastie? : http://pastie.org/2408631
It's a function from renjikken's binary tree.
I noticed that reversing endianness produced an exploitable pattern.
Not sure if it's a hack or part of Wolfram's original idea.
Oh, the logic's off ever so slightly. You get the idea, though.
naosia: The state is just an enum, naosia, if I remember correctly.
it's just enumeration.
So that you can use words instead of numbers.
{ON, OFF, MAYBE_ON} becomes {1, 2, 3}
What are you even trying to do, shader?
What are you partitioning with?
^
Makes no sense.
Zero-fill the partition table./
Takes liek a second.
And then whatever the hell you're using will jus treat the disk as blank.
Which disk are you trashing?
sda?
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda
Just let it run for maybe 5 seconds and then ctrl-c
I like the pastie themes.
Hah. So long as those first 512 bytes are gone you're good to go.
What the hell guided partitioner is this?
What are you installing?
Later, naosia.
Feels like it would have been less trouble at this point...

Or remember a commit to one of the repos by him?
Also, renjikken, read my code already.
Notch is a turbofag and you know it.
Liek Julian Clarie or Graham Norton or somebody like that.
They're celebrity turbofags.
Liek Notch.
Just loooook: http://pastie.org/2408631
Yup. reversing the endianness grouped all the ON results together.
aka it's a hack.
I just happened ot notice the pattern.
Elaborate, redlizard.
As in use a 3d array?
because that thought had crossed my mind.
value[2][2][2]
And simply return [left][center][right]
redlizard: That was what I was going to do until I realised that reversing endianness meant you could do the same thing with value comparisions.
The machien makes no difference.
[left * 4 + above * 2 + right * 1] is a messy way of doing lines 76 to 81.
Not sure what the efficiency differences would be like.
But yes, what you're suggesting looks to be exactly the same as what i've written but without the 8-element table lookup at the end.
Because value comparisons work in this case.
But a table lookup was what I was writing when I realised that this endianness created a group of "ON" values together.
As far as i know the On and OFFs are just macros or enums for 0 and 1.
Well, to be honest, the whole algo could be handled very efficiently by working with the value of 2 2-byte pieces of memory if wer'e taking that route.
I was more interested in the hacky solve than the implementation.
Link to Notch's feed?
3>Implyign I siad it would take 10 minutes
Probably not.

You see the beauty of installign via chroot, now?
Watching someone code is actually reasonably theraputic.

My Debian is Stable, shader.
naosia: Did you use -jX
?
naosia: Utilises parallel compiling.
make by default only uses 1 core.
It's fairly standard to make with therads for the number of cores you have +1.
So on my 4-core machine I make -j5.
^
Programs compile in parts.
All the .cpp files get turned into .o files one at a time.
That's how you're able to do things in parallel.
Ack.
Well, more threads = everythign else is less responsive.

Why have a separate term for the compiler? What's wrong with :make ?
:O
You literally just dum in your compiler command.
You need to crack on with C, my boy!
Only because you don't have a real project.
And you're probably choking on simple stuff like string handling.
Surely you jest. c is the most flexible language going.
You've been spoiled by scripting languages.
I can assure you, though, that understanding what's going on under the hood is the difference between the men and the boys.
And it'll make a good programmer out of you.
but don't you want to understand what's actually happening when you write a program? the bastraction is nice but there's so much more to know.
read the first chapter of The Art Of Exploitation. I think it might just change your mind.
It handles C and ASm in a very simplistic way and steps over GDB.
GNU Debugger.
Possibly the most wonderful tool available to any programmer ever,
... if you know how to use it.
Almost certainly not.
You'll knwo if you're using it.
Because it's a great tool and makes programming in general much easier.
Because it's a crash course in C, ASM, machine code and debugging all in very few pages.
Without any waffle.
Simple, up-to-date instructions with code available.
Oh, no, "steps over" as in "shows you step-by-step how to use" not "avoids"
But if you knew C and ASM you could get jobs like that.
Or you could say that you have passing experience with C, ASM and GDB but that you've literally just touched the tip of the iceberg.
And then you'd show that you're personally interested but correct for the position.
Soudns liek a fun job.

Hey, one[coding].
Libertarianism. Do Americans just think it's a right-wing political party?
I mean... they know what authoritarianism is, right?
Yeah, I guess I see your point. generalising isn't the correct thing to do.
I identify as a left-wing libertarian and literally every time I say it anywhere with American people I end up having to explain.
Yeah, see, the trouble with politically "independent" people is that they can be all over the political spectrum, too.
Two party system.
Breaks democracy.
Especially when neither of the 2 big choices particularly represents you.
Recently the only 2 viable choices in the U.K. have been a centrist and a right-wing party. No leftist option at all.
^^
Politics is something you should become involved in BECAUSE OF YOUR OTHER INTERESTS.
Not for the sake of politics.
But... conservatism in government has led America to the awful patent wars that are currently going on.
Economic conservatism = Allowing corporate lobbying in government = Allowing awful abuses of "intellectual property" laws = Anti-competitive practise.
That's economic libertarianism.
Laissez Faire causes a polarised market...
And an inability for the entrapaneur to compete.

So the government's job in the people-business ratio should be to protect the people and entrapaneurs, not the businesses themselves.

Oops, caps.
if there's a rash of sexually-driven serial killings in this guy's area I'm just going to go to his house and fucking shoot him because it's definitely him.
Later, naosia.
Surely you jest.
It's women and children first because they're physically weaker than you.
You have a better chance of *both* surviving if she goes first.
Or, to put it another way,
She has more chance of dying if left alone than if a man is left alone.
I'm all for equality but I'm also all for protecting those physically weaker than yourself.
Sure.
I'm sure you'd be happy living with yourself because you jus got out when you had the chance and left people to die.
That, to me, is the difference between a man and a child.
A man protects those around him.
When it's hopeless, you leave, but if you help you stay.

A man bites the top off of beer bottles.
And lights matches on his chin.
Which is fine.
We just happen to be considerably more physically able than other human beings.
Not really.
3>Many women are stronger than many men
Nope.
I weigh 1.5x the average weight of a woman. I'm also 8 inches taller than the average woman.
Bahahahhaa
The point is, though, that the average man is considerably more capable than the average woman.
Well, it is...
mm. I don't think so.
if I look at my male friends and then my female friends there's a huge difference.
Nope.png
And?
Are you saying my friends are an unfair sampling?
if I walk through the supermarket it's the same thing. The people you see day-to-day.
The men are more physically capable than the women and noticably so.

Ah, good.
I really wanted someone else to do that.
3>mfw Stallman is talking about BitCoins as the only anonymous form of payment on the internet.
He's right, though. BitCoins are a great idea.
BitCoins are a great idea because they're anonymous and decentralised.
Small payments.
How do you get "fucked over?"
So put them on a USB flash drive and physically keep them secure.
Treated the same as any other kind of property or data theft.
Oh fucking brilliant.
To Stallman: "Can you imagine, hypothetically, any situation where running non-free software is acceptable?"
Stallman: "When you're working to make a free replacement for that non-free software."
Fair and valid point.
And well thought out.
Oh, man, I'm definitely going ot see Stallman on Friday and getting him to sign my books.

Low-grade programming discussion.

I like it but haven't looked into it extensively.
It will most likely become my higher-level language of choice at some point.
The last I checked not every distro had a compiler in repos, though, which is a downside.
Makes it difficult to collaborate/convince people to do so.
3>AUR
3>Golang IDE
AUr is insanity
Well, it is.
Autofetch, build and install scripts.
i.e. a bunch of Arch users control the repo
innocuous: This is true. The main point, however, is that the AUR doesn't host any actual software and it's all fetched from 3rd-party servers by the scripts.
Which means that you have 2 very major points of failure already.
1 -- The AUR maintainer could fuck you over
2 -- the software is downloaded unsigned from a 3rd party
Which is fine, except even that only diminishes problem 1.
You also have the problem of *accidental* ineptitude.
And you also have the problem that i know for a *fact8 that most Arch users just won't even look.
I trust my instincts on this one.
Because I've read the Arch forums.
I red the entierty of Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained in bed last night. Your opinion is irrelevant.
Also, books general?
Need some nice fiction to add to my list because I'm almost out of Arthur C. Clarke.
And if somebody doesn't suggest something good I'm probably going to read The Timetraveller's Wife, which is a bitch book.
This seems interesting. Investigating.
Soudns liek a simple fix.
There don't seem to be any advantages to doing so.
No reason not to just run it as a restricted user.
It's a multi-user program, amirite?
i.e. owned by root but with execution permissions for multiple users
Or at least I believe it has the functionality to be used like that.
Well, I don't see any reason to use a chroot if you're running it as a single user.
The security improvements are minimal.
No, chown, but it looks very interesting...

Nothing, Manhose, just working through my reverse engineering book and realised I could do with a good brute-force archive cracker.
But I'll probably just use John the Ripper for now.
ShameOnATrip: Emacs uses Emacs Lisp.
Vim has no embedded language.
Emacs Lisp is an integral part of the editor.
Not really.
You can't even do simple search-and-replace, for example.
replace-string is a lisp function.
There are some really ncie ones, though, chown.
<number>G
Jump to line number.
"A" puts you in insert mode at the end of the current line.
Movement commands combined with "d" are handy for efficient deletion.
Movement command combined with "c" are like those with "c" but leave you in insert mode.
Things like that.
Do "w" moves you wordwrds a word and "b" moves you backwards a word.
"5w" moves you forwards 5 words.
"d5b" deleted 5 words working backwards.
etc. etc.
you're not expected ot know it all right away, it's just something you pick up as you use it.
domsto: I've heard Python The Hard Way be highly recommended.
I've never read either, but I beleiev some of the guys on here found it to be a very good introductory book.

Good morning everybody, it's a fiiine Friday and this is Guns & Roses with "You Could Be Mine."
Link to your project site again, one[coding]1 ?
domsto: That tends ot be hard to quantify.
Because people program in different amounts over time in different languages.
I wrote my first computer program in BASIC in either 1987 or 1988.
I was in primary school, anyway, and the school computers all ran some form of BASIC.
They probably had 10 or more BBc Micros.
Not really.
He told a story the other day in a lecture about a piece of software he was asked to improve recently and he did it but couldn't remember the name.
He remember it in the end but I can't remember what it is, now.
remembered*
domsto: Computing is different nowdays.
people who grew up in the 80s were part of the home computing revolution and all of those computers had BASIC interpreters as the shell.
All of my friends -- even the non-technical ones who ended up working in a supermarket -- all knew how to program at least a little.
Because otherwise you couldn't use your computer.
People who grew up in the 90s never learnt ot use a CLI.
And, by extension, never learnt the basics of programming as just something you know from using your computer.
^
And it means that people are really divided now between being able to program because they studied it intensely or not being able to do it at all.
When really it's a skill every computer user should have.
I think I said it the other day but... not being able to make your computer count from 1 to 10 just seems totally ridiculous.
3>Watching people amble about badly unable to use a mouse
So yeah. Variables and basic automation are things which the average person just can't do. Which is insanity.
And yes, this idea of "point at the stuff I want/want to select"
But it's not their fault. They've been babies.
And Microsoft have enouraged this kind of learned helplessness to foster a network of support software.
babied*
Thus, Microsoft have created within their operating system a potentially commercial environment of opportunities for software made for helpless people.
And Emacs.
Because it's difficult and obtuse.

3>not listening to rush
3>2112
Anybody who hasn't listened to it ^^
Listen to it.
No, it doesn't slacky.
The GPL exists to allow you the privelege of something to learn from.
It sounds like you're considering making non-free software, though, which is something you should reconsider.
3>GPL
3>restrictive
The GPL doesn't restrict your own ability to implement something, based off of your own research.
the algorithm isn't GPLed.
The specific code they use is.
That's a matter of *how* you implement them, then.
if you just block-copy it from GPLed code then it's a violation.
If you study the GPLed code and then implement it yourself you're not.
Any non-trivial algorithm will have sufficient complexity that a direct copy will be obvious.
It's not stealing if it's a concept. you can't own an idea.
American patents would argue that you can.
European patents allow you to own an implementation of an idea.
The GPL is rarely enforced. It's more a social and political statement than anything.
If you have source code available then it should be clear that you've not made copies.
Later, domsto.
I mean for 3rd party verification, slacky.
I think I know the answer to this already.
That's right, slacky. teh code is free for you to study.
Block-copying code is not allowed, though.
Point made.
BSD = penniless.
the FSF have done it a few times.
yes, slacky.
People rip off ffmpeg somethign rotten.
Especially on Apple's mobile platforms.
I'm working through a book on reverse engineering at the moment. Seriously considering studying a non-free image format and the method by which it was reverse engineered.
YOU CAN'T PLAY SHOOTAN GAMES ON THAT
Generic Army Shooter #928434
Oddly enough, SERNBot has identified the colour of every object and person in that game.
That's nice.
I like games that are about decision-making.
Elite is a good one.
It also has twitchy-finger shootan action.
Team gameplay hardly makes a game a cerebral workout.
Fake.
3>Mid-air projection
I'm sure you find that very fun.
When you're playing your shootan game.
Planescape: Torment it most certainly is not, however.
No, I'm just stating my opinion about generic shootan games.
And I don't believe the pretence that it's at all cerebral.
I'm played shootan games wherein there is a team element before. People are always pushing me to play them saying that that you have to think about tactics etc. etc..
And it's always bland, with a minimal of thought required for tactics.
Shadowrun was one.
Orin: I enjoyed Portal.
And Deux Ex.
Not overly, but ab it.
Left 4 Dead was probably the best shootan game I've played in a while.
Orin: I enjoyed the story.
Yup.
3>Hard
Twitch-monkey stuff.
Well, it is.
So?
There's nothing impressive about them?
IDGAF
You're wasting your life away playing that shit.
Maybe you should listen to him, chown.
And read a book.
but at least he doesn't play shootan games all day.
But you see my point, right? You could be discussing or reading about ideas but instead you choose to play a bland game with no story.
Max payne had an interesting story. I enjoyed the first one.
Never played #2.
But that's my point, chown. it's a rather base distraction.
chown: Have you ever read Paradise Lost? It's a rather slim volume of maybe 200 pages.
read a book instead.
I feel bad for you if you can't do something fun and productive at the same time.
I understand the thrill of competition. I used to play all kinds of sports when I was in school.
At least that contributes to the 90 minutes of exercise you need per week to add 3 years to your life.
3>reading a book isn't productive
Good books discuss interesting ideas.
Far more interesting that any other media.
Orin: It's competitive *AND* healthy.
Chess improves your logical thinking and pattern regocnition.
Competition is not always productive. being the best CS player is not a productive goal.
Bull SHIT
hand eye co-ordination BULL SHIT
The story was an interesting idea, though.
My creative mind was stimulated.
Good, chown, so you might be a slightly better surgeon if you play computer games.
I would argue that painting would also make you a better surgeon.
And like I said before: if you can't enjoy something productive then I feel bad for you.
Then do that instead.
Net gain. 2-for-one deal.
Something creative or something that improves the self is productive.
Orin: Discussing issues is a productive way to spend time.
Orin: That depends on what your objectives are.
YOU might not be achieving much.
But the next time I have this conversation I'll be able to cut out the bullshit and get right to the meat of the argument, because my own views have been shaped by what you guys have been saying.
I'm more clear about my own standpoint now than I was before and I've compounded this fact: People who just want to play game will make all kinds of excuses to justify that want.
Orin: It's the extension of personal philosophy that's beign discussed.
You may see only a discussion about video games but the matter goes deeper to philosophical roots.
3>BUT IT IMPROVES HAND-EYE COORDINATION
3>BUT IT *IS* PRODUCTIVE
because I think you know depp down, chown, that you *could* be doing productive things instead of watching the vidya.

Even watching a movie is more productive than playing the same map again and again on multiplayer.
Orin: It's investing time in a pointless skill.
But the fact that you're learnign to do something pointless masks the fact that it is, in fact, pointless.
Yes it is, cherriez.
It's objectively pointless.
The skill is a pointless one. When will that skill ever have a use?
Not anything.
Jesus, you guys are fucking insane.
Studying physics is pointless?
Hah. So the problem we have here is a simple one of scope.
You guys are willing to lay down on the floor like nihilists and go EVERYTHIGN HAS THE SAME VALUE WHICH IS NOTHING BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE WILL EVENTUALLY CEASE TO BE
Well, will you agree that furthering science is a more poigniant task than honing your CoD skills?
I think there are so many interesting things to study that repetitive gameplay is so low on the list that I have no idea why you would do it.
chown: Well, it's pretty clear that that's where our difference is.
chown: I'm having to answer several people, here.
I'm reading, I just can't type as fast as the 3 of you.
Orin: UnPRODUCTIVE competition.
You can compete in productive fields, too.
Maintaining a social group is important.
Especially when I need people to help me move on Thursday.
Orin: I think the vast, VAST majority of people will say that honing your CoD skills is unproductive.
Perhaps, but at worst playing through Portal and finding it to be disappointingly unproductive is only 2 or 3 hours of your afternoon gone.
Socialising over games is a poor substitute for real socialising.
I know lots of people who have underdeveloped social skills because they spent their formative years playing games online.
Which is an argument for computer games actually being soewmat destructive when take to a certain point.
Which is fine.
But you can see a real societal effect with vidya.
chown: But vidya game aspies really do exists and in considerable enough numbers that we probably all know at least one.
I heard that McDonald's burgers have to have the salad included otherwise they would be classed as deserts.
An unproductive amount of sugar.

Also, I hate waiting at the counter for my burger.
yeah, they write on the packing with a grease pencil. you've probably seen it before.
And they mark things like "no cheese" etc.
And they put a mark on a clock-like biut on the paper to tell them at what time the burger was put in that hooded heater bit.
Yeah, to tell the truth, I'm actually super hungry for McDonald's now.
chown: They might not do it in mcDonald's any more. I know they still do it in Burger King, though, because I was forced to stop in on a trip a month ago.

3>mfw xorg-server 1.11 has a crach-bug with opengl.
I would have typed "crash bug" but I was distracted by you even suggesting BSD.
If you're going ot do that then why not use the GPL?
No, it's not.
But you're using a "do whatever the fuck you want" license to give people freedom, yes?
the nwhy not guarantee freedom forever and use GPL?
GPL: "I'm going to give you freedom to do with this software whatever you wish and nodoby can take that away."
Yes.
Because without the sources they've broken the the freedosm that you originally gave.
Man, could Stallman be much more of a socially hopeless geek?
chown: if you're accepting that you're going ot get no return for it then yoru choice is essentially, then, between giving freedom to the game's users and giving freedom to people who would "monetise" the project.
... and who would potentially create a rival project using your own software against you.
Urg.
Apathy regarding licensing is the reason we're in the situation we are now.
BSD is an apathetic license. It's the "I wash my hands of whatever you do with this software" license.
Which is a shirking of your responsibility as the software's original author.
But they're then using your code to restrict what people are able to do with software they own.
You may not care if your software is distributed in a calculated way in an attempt to keep users helpless, but I think that you're not acting morally in doing so.
being able to do something != it is a morally right action
i could walk up to you and shoot you in the head. People need to be protected from that happening.

Good. Then prevent it from being made non-free.
Because crippling it is exactly what you're doing when you refuse to provide source.
FOSS, clearly.
chown: But you're also providing a promise with the GPL that you won't arbitrarily restrict their ability to modify or redistribute the game in the eyes of the law.
With python being "closed source"  isn't the problem. The GPL is just a reassuring "yes, this game is free and you cna make changes and improve it" to your users.
naosia: You highlighted me abotu 5 hours ago.

It's normally something along the lines of sdl1.2-dev and sdl_image1.2-dev

aptitude search sdl | grep dev
[ @LAMMJohnson ] It's normally something along the lines of sdl1.2-dev and sdl_image1.2-dev
Those are the 2 dependencies you need.
Yeah, there's no way those are the only sdl packages in the Debian repos.
You should at least have libsdl1.2 libsdl_image1.2 libsdl_mixer1.2 etc.
And also the development versions of those packages.
Yup.

Hey, Manhose, which algo did you use for the maze in Dungeon?

3>mfw I knew it was domsto askign that question over and over on 4chan.
domsto: Yeah, just learn one and use it. It's not a difficult subject for you to fret about -- if you find you need to learn the other later just learn it then.
Pretty soon you should be writing those scripts.
Automating little things like that are pretty much the POINT of scripting languages.
domsto: Your editor setup is something that evolves over time.
For example, I've been using vim for years and now my editor looks liek this: http://ompldr.org/vYTM1Yw
Which would have totally put me off initially because there's just too much information there.

I know you've done us a favour by doing this much already but if I asked you super-duper nicely do you think you could do us a ceiling?
Either way, I'm good to switch up the default tileset to this whenever you're ready. Just make a pull request or whatever method you want to do.
Yeah, one[coding].

No need to be gimmicky about it -- it's a service to your visitors that you let them choose how they want things displayed.
Like chown said.
And vlink colour.
But the point still stands -- it would be easy to allow users to choose their own forground colour.
Having said that, the links are a little *too* dark.
Worse than the bright green?
http://ompldr.org/vYW1wdQ
And shit that matches your system setup is much nicer.
Because bright green can be grating.
basically, because you're only using 1 foreground colour (and a dulled version for visited links) it would be easy to allow users to choose the colour they wish to view in.
1 sec
Cool, GETOUT. Keep me informed.
auREAX: An example of what? A different colourscheme?
GETOUT: I'd happily follow. Even if I didn't program I'd happily play and learn Esperanto.
I'd much prefer a subdued grey foreground, for example.
Might I suggest giving the option to change the monchrome colour, though?
Looks fine enough, auREAX.
Also, I'd happily take a good excuse to learn Esperanto.
GETOUT: I'm not really interested in working on anything big at the moment. I do need an excuse to delve deeper into CL some time, though.
auREAX: As in "Is it just an art demo/mock-up or does it actually work?"
GETOUT: Yes, you're quite right. The type system seems pretty optional to me at this stage, though, as I normally add explicit type declarations way late (don't feel experienced enough to write them first) and Haskell seems to handle it fine.
auREAX: Looks nice. What functionality does it provide?
auREAX: What am I looking at?
As far as I can tell the compiler/interpreter handle typing for you pretty much flawlessly if you don't want to be strict.
What exactly were your problems with the type system?
Booyeah.
Hah.
Just talking about my own experiences regarding what i consider to be a language after my own heart.
Oh, don't get me wrong. i'm not trying to sell you on it.
Love the partial application.
Love the type system.
Well, you don't need currying to do partial application. I assume the computer could handle that other ways.
i.e. partial application.
I never got deep enough into any of the Lisps to find out if they do Curried functions. I would assume so?
(func1 . func2 . func3 . func4) x
vs
(func1 (func2 (func3 (func4 x))))
It does Lisp-y stuff but fixes the lisp syntax.
You know what I really like about Haskell?
And not in a totally stupid adding-stuff-for-idiots way.
It's interesting in how different it is.
That's why I picked up Haskell.
I've seen it. I just don't really see its use.
And I might enjoy playing with lego for a bit even now, although the novelty would probably wear off soonish, if you get me.
I played with them both as a kid. They were formative tools that I'll always think very fondly of.
BASIC and Lego are in the same category for me.
They're my core 3.
C for any real projects.
Perl does quick and dirty.
When I might have to go back to maintain a script, for example, I like Python.
Python is my halfway point.
Exactly.
I prefer to see my memory allocation handled properly.
Indeed.
As we all do.
But I also need scripts occasionally.
So yes, I like my programs to be surgically lightweight.
Which is why I dislike generics.
If I'm making something that's going to be used a lot I like to do it *RIGHT*, which means taking my time over things like data structures.
"Speed junkie?"
Although I'm much better with Perl than Python.
C and Python give me the same feeling.
It just gives me the same feeling I get from my other favourite languages -- that it's extremely good design.
I fucking love this language.
            palindromeInBase x y = digits x y == digitsRev x y
    where   palindromeInBoth x = palindromeInBase 10 x && palindromeInBase 2 x
prob_36 = sum $ filter palindromeInBoth [1..999999]
I'm interested in learning Ruby, but I highly doubt I'll be as smitten with it as I am with Haskell.
Yup.
The most beautiful programming language since C.
Like a goddamn BAWS
prob_30 = sum $ filter powerOfItsOwnDigits [2..1000000] where powerOfItsOwnDigits x = sum (map (^5) (digits 10 x)) == x
Good choice.
I normally run through the early Euler problems when I learn a language to cement my knowledge.
Booyeah.

Ruby has C-like syntax.
Hey, chown.

Even though faggots like nand bang on about their importance in languages in which they don't really fit nicely.

Web browsers don't get much simpler than this.
I haven't found one that works how I like it to, so I'm making my own.
Surf and uzbl both have trouble with tabs, for example, so I'm building it with tab support from the ground up.
For example, uzbl hangs when closing a tab until that tab is closed.
I know, right?
I also hate shit being visible all the fucking time, so I'm going to hide all GUI unless alt is held down.
Or the CLi is being used.
For those too lazy to compile, it works perfectly as-is already: http://ompldr.org/vYWJocQ
Scrolling, text selection and link following all have sane defaults.

Yes.
If you thought Surf was barebones you haven't seen SHIT yet.
I'll also be taking the "use a config.h file for configuring" and taking it a step further. Unused parts will be compiled out at build time.
Which means people will be able to write add-ons as modules.
Compile them in as you want them.
It makes sense. It's good design.
I might even make the vi-like stuff a module.
So that you can choose your UI at compile time.
And then others can create their own UIs.
Pick the parts you want and away you go.
Great idea or greatest idea?
And you can see how easy it is. I reckon I can get it to the point of being modularly compilable at 200-300 LOC.
Exactly.
I'll get it to the point of allowing modules and then make some basic modules to get it to the point where it's usable for me.
And then whatever.
Sure. I'll create just enough that it's usable off-the-bat.

I can never remember how to find the nth subnet.
Oh wait, I remember.
redlizard: As in finding the 64th subnet of 172.16.0.1/23
You know what a subnet is, right?
So you know that a class B address like 172.16.0.1/23 has been split into 128 subnets
0.0*
Yeah, there are a few mental tricks for determining where different subnets begin.
Well, 172.16.0.0 is a class B reserved private address.
brb
11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000
AND
xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxx0.1000000x
Gives the 64th subnet
I believe.
I don't think it is, redlizard. Care to explain?
Oh, perhaps you're right. Maybe I'm a byte too late in my maths.
i.e. hence I can never remember the method.
redlizard: Stop shifting the subnet mask about.
The mask. You can't just change it.
Else your'e no longer talking about the nth subnet.
The subnet is there to help routers know where to send data.
Because you're subnetting an address you're given. You subnet it and can then make a VLSM later but you don't just change the subnet to make the maths easier.
If you need x many hosts per subnet then you need x many hosts per subnet. Make your mask and then work with it.
But the /30 is a mistake.
Because the mask is /23.
No.
Your'e subnetting /16 into smaller parts. It's a class B address.
We're not talking about VLSM.
There you go.
3>"64th subnet of 172.16.0.1/23"
Derp.
Class B address.
Makes for 7 subnet bits.
Nope.png
No, it doesn't.
It means /23 is the subnet mask.
How can it have subnets without already havign a subnet mask?
You can't find the 64th subnet of an address that hasn't BEEN SUBNETTED.
No, it's really not.
No, it means the /23 is the subnet mask and you need to find the 64th subnet.
Yes, it does.
If somebody gives you a class B subnet address and a subnet mask and asks you to find the nth subnet the answer is, surprisingly, the nth subnet USING THE ADDRESS AND SUBNET THEY JUST GAVE YOU.
class B network address*
You must have missed this line:
3>0.0*
Sure, it does.

It is if you want any of Java's "features."
Like making live changes.
Are you in some way implying that programs compiled for generic architectures will run worse then interpreted bytecode ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE COMPILED FOR GENERAL ARCHITECTURES?
Hugely verbose GARBAGE.
No, but it has everything to do with library calls.
The libs are still natively compiled. It's the only way Java can be "fast".
3>He thinks the entire Java library is blazin' fast interpreted bytecode
OK, add shitty core libs to the list of anti-features as well, then.
There's literally nothing that Java does that isn't done better elsewhere.
I don't give a fuck about JIT. JIT is dumbfuck design.
There's no fucking reason for it.
JIT is an anti-feature.
Why? There's no fucking benefit.
Just compile at install time.
Anything that'll take more than a few seconds to compile from C will slow the JVM to a crawl.
Else just use a generic binary. It'll STILL be faster than the JVM.
And requires no compilation at all.
We're talking about Java.
Where JIT is pointless.
There are situations where JIT makes sense.
In Lisp, for example.
Hey, naosia.

Also, there's a pdf of said book that weighs in at ~3MB. I have a copy if you're interested.
When you build a project you compile .cpp files down into .o files.
Which are machine language.
And then when you compile the file with your main function you bundle in all the .o files as well.
And then your linker does any linking it needs to do.
Run "make" in the same directory.
"Makefile"

Also, the $< on the 2nd line should be $^

Manhose: You about?
What is "Afficher Etu?"
And "Racine" ?
OK, so, if I choose option 5 in your program right at the start then there should be no students in the list?
"5: Lister les tudiants" >> List the students?
OK, if you choose option 5 then ListerEtu() gets passed a dangling pointer, and passes a dangling pointer to AfficherEtu().
So the problem seems to be that your root node isn't properly initialised to NULL.
And GererChoix is also passed that pointer...
If root is not initialised then it needs to be NULL. that's correct.
but you MUST NOT try to set root's member variables unless it is initialised.
Because the dereferencing will try to access an area of memory near 0x00000000
OK, so, there is an in instance of noeud there.
But there shouldn't be because no students exist.
Yes.
And until then Racine should be NULL.
Yes.
And any print functions should chekc to see if (Racine != NULL) before they try to access it.
I'm trying to look at how you're handling data now.
But yes, make root the first student and then add/show students in relation to that one.
I see what you're saying.

alt0173: AfficherEtu needs to check if *Elem != NULL
Manhose: Debugging a binary tree in C++. Thought you might be able to help.
np, hose.
Yes. Segfaults.
That's how I'm doing it.
Also, the program is in French.
AfficherEtu calls it when it's NULL.
I believe...
yeah, that's one bit fixed.
ListerEtu takes the root node and recursively displays every node's values.
You set the root node's "Valuer" to NULL in Initialiser()
Correctly, no less.
Yeah, you look like you're struggling with similar errors in other places.
The best thing to do is jump on a debugger and look at the backtrace from where the segfault occurred.
That looks to be from a different place.
On GNU+Linux you can compile with the flag -ggdb and then use GDB to backtrace.
literally just enter:
gdb nodes
run
(run until a segfault)
backtrace
-----
And it'll show you the stack backtrace.
And then you either add a guard against NULL values, follow the variable to its source and make sure it's initialised properly or dynamically allocate a variable that's going out of scope.
P.S. I think your problem is the last one.
Add -ggdb after the "g++" commands.
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x000000000040282b in AjouterCour (Liste=0x0, Cour=...) at fonctions.cpp:189

You're trying to access a member variable here when the parent is pointing to memory you don't have permission to point to.
That's a 64 bit system.
Your value is probably just being shortened for readability.
Although, having said that, 0xfeeefeee implies that your heap is growing downwards from 0xffffffff
You need to work with a debugger, alt0173. There are quite a few memory access errors here.
Can I see proof of said trolling?
^
Now you just have a symptomless error.
But sometimes subtle differences are worse for the uninitiated than glaring ones.
Nothing worse than tons of niggling problems when you're already struggling.
Later, auREAX.
That'll be it.
That depends what you're doing.
Why are you freeing that memory?
It's obviously still being used.
Delete it when you're done using it.
And you don't need to create a new pointer. Your previously allocated nodes have pointers for you to use.
Yeah, this is a problem with understanding pointers.
Have you worked with linked lists before?
Pointers just contain a value that represents a location in memory.
"new whetever" allocates some memory and returns the location it used.
So what you wnat to be doing is finding the pointer that will hold the location of the next node and returning the address to that.
So, for example, root->left->left has a value
But root->left->left->left is NULL.
So you set root->left->left->left to the value of "new node();"
And your chain continues.
And you don't free any part of the chain until the end.
And to find that tip you can do something like:
for (Node *n = root; root->next != NULL; n = n->next);
for (Node *n = root; n != NULL; n = n->next);
even
basically you should be storing the value of new nodes in the left or right pointers of your existing nodes.
storing the address*
Can you give a line reference for this?
Also, after a return statement nothing happens.
So line 173 is pointless.
Root->left is NULL or dangling until you set it.
What is "Afficher" ?
And "Ajouter" ?
OK
if (Noeud->Gauche == NULL && *Noeud > *Etu)
else if (Noeud->Gauche != NULL && *Noeud->Gauche < *Noeud)
These value comparisons
Are comparing memory addresses.
Which is definitely not what you want.
What are you trying to do there?
I don't think you understand what you're doing here.
"if (the value at address Noeud is greater than the value at the address Etu)"
Ah, OK.
I forgot that you're overloading the basic arithmetic operators.
OK.
Still, don't delete Etu.
Etu *the pointer* can be reassigned to point to another object. the value Etu points at needs to be kept.
Because the value Etu points at is now being pointed to somewhere in your binary tree.
That's right.
Modern computers free all memory a program was using when it exits anyway, so don't stress too much.
But for systems that need to run for months at a time it's essential.
Getting there, at least.

string.h needs to have a standard function to tell you how many tokens strtok will return with a given string and set of delimiters.
Basically, strtok splits a string into individual tokens given a base string and delimiters to use.
But you don't know how many tokens the string will contain without figuring it out (or already knowing) yourself.
So you can either allocate a great big lump of memory (awful practise) or allocate a great big lump of memory and then transfer the contents to dynamically allocated memory (messy, still bad)
Or write a function that determines how many tokens will be returned. this is always the superior choice.
But it can be a bit complicated to write because you have to follow strtok()'s behaviour *EXACTLY*.
Niggardly

http://pastebin.com/AZ1VVRXC
PATH is in caps because it's a mirror of the environmental variable $PATH.
ORIGPATH is in caps because it exists purely to be an untouched copy of PATH.
binlist is a static global.
pathparts points to a mangled version of PATH, which... Oh, wait, you're right.
No, wait.
PATH and pathparts point to the same area of memory by the end of the function.
Because srttok mangles the string fed to it in place.

auREAXiki: That's essentially what strtok does.
Anything else? Having another pair of eyes looking over my spaghetticode is always extremely welcome.
What's this #198 #189 stuff I'm seeing?
Not too worried about those points, auREAXiki. On errors the program exits gracefully with an error message and clears all the memory it was using.
And the mallocs will be replaced with safe_mallocs when I get around to it.

Don't tell my girlfriend.
Don't blame him.
I was thining more of an "X" or similar displayed in one corner of the active window.
When the super key is held down.
How are you enjoying the hacking?
Yes, there's a function to unmap windows.
Not sure how dwm handles it.
Soudns like it's not been attached to the left monitor correctly.
OK,
it sounds like windows that are moved aren't being added to the head of the LL correctly.
I reckon their ->next isn't being assigned correctly.
To the previous head.
->next moves further back towards the root window.
The head of the Ll is at the front and visible.
Buh?
I did, although I didn't see that.
So you've put the currently visible window in the *middle* of the linked list somewhere?
Nononononono!
Bad design.
The visible window should be at the tip or, if you have a good reason, the end.
Either way, it's much harder to make logic to work with an object at some arbitrary middle point than an extreme.
It also means that you can pop in new window/client objects like this:
Client *c = malloc(sizeof(Client)); c->next = &Tip; Tip = c;
Hrm. I see what you mean. My switching was actually popping the second element to the tip every time.
But the point is that when a new window opens it's the new tip.
Oh, OK. I thought you meant that you were insertign new windows into the middle of the list.
But I get what you mean. You changed my erroneous bring-to-tip behaviour for proper movement through the LL.
So what's the deal with "spaces" ? I wanted ot leave them out of design until EX^N had a proper interface to show you where you're working to avoid confusion before I broguth them in.
As do I.
But you get why I wanted to get everything else working first?
I'd quite like to be able to merge the branches.
So that work can be shared.
I was looking at Xlib stuff to draw window highlights when the super key is held down.
I also found a neat trick for having Xerrors passed to a function we can define.
I believe the default Xerror behaviour is a crash with minor error reporting, which doesn't help us overly.
Segfault on quitting? Should be easy to debug with gdm.
Is it every time or under specific conditions?
OK, give me 2 seconds to suss it out.

OK, so, the *bad* news is that I can't reproduce the segfault.
the good news is NO SEGFAULTS HERE
ACTION cheers
You'll need to debug it.

Also, you could check the return value of the program.
No idea where it goes.
You could simply pipe the program's output to a file.
Anyway, back later.
I'll dump in a function to handle xerrors tomorrow if I get aorund to it.
If you try and do somethign to a window that no longer exists, for example, Xlib exits with a crash.
Which is pretty impractical and useless to us.
it's not a segfault.
It's just standard Xlib error behaviour to spit out some minimal debug information and call exit();

It's also a giant subject on which big thick books have been written.
The idea of how to design software *well* isn't agreed upon by anyone ever.
Depends on the language. Depends on the environment.
Depends on how it's going ot be used.
Depends on how much time I plan to spend developing it.
Which is upsetting, because it's much nicer to just give a straight answer.
auREAX: What do you mean?
As in... you don't get why your design choices would be affected by the language you choose (or vice versa) ?
Well, you might not take an OO approach at all if you're intending using Perl or JavaScript for example.
The point isn't whether the language is OO _capable_, but whether the best way to design what you need is to use a specific language in that very specific way.
It sounds like what you're talking about is actually the use of dtaabases.
You can very quickly and efficiently access databases for searches without even thinking about OO as a paradigm.
Simple scripting language accesses a database, displays results.
3>got all kind of different things like web, images, maps etc
The example was in regards to databases.
If you're talking about web design then the way in which you handle each of those pages is *extremely* language-specific.
Straight Perl would generate a different page entirely for each of those options, most likely with a function to dump the map/picture/web search specific stuff.
On top of that you might dump in some javascript to make the search update in-place or you'd continue to use Perl to generate the pages for results 1-10, 11-20, 21-30 etc.
I'm just riffing. To be honest, I don't know what exactly you're working on because the amount of information you've given isn't anywhere near enough to give solid advice.
You can't spell "pimples" without "pimp."

Oh, hey, I had a conversation with a guy today -
I thought piss bottles were a myth.
But this guy was telling me he actually used to piss in cups
And throw it out of the window en masse.
And when his parents sold his old house the red of the roof had been bleached white where he'd thrown so much piss out of the window.
This guy is one of the funniest people I've ever met.
irl conversation.
He was a "gamer" in his teens.
And he still is a bit now.

He was also telling me he wore the same pair of underwear for 6 months.
And his parents burnt them in the back garden to stop him from wearing them.
Gotta respect the guy for being honest.

3>mfw tinyscheme is 58KB
A really tiny scheme interpreter.
Small enough that you could fit the source code on to a floppy disk 24 times over.
Which is, frankly, fucking amazing.
Read O'Reilly Flex and Bison.
You'll need to learn how to use a lexer and a parser to understand how lexers and parsers work.
Good for you.
I was talking to chown, though.
Still, if you're a bit more advanced; have you read the "dragon" book?
Programs.
Flex is C and C++ only.
But, then, C and C++ are pretty much the core of what you'll be wanting ot know for anything but trivial stuff. There's really nothing that compares.
Well, it really depends upon what you want to parse and why.
C and C++ will let you do anything. Scripting or managed languages will severely limit your options.
You don't even need a real parser for that.
Even things like parsing large configuration files don't really need a *parser*.
But are best handled titily with one.
tidily*
You're really just going to be splitting a string into tokens and handling it that way realistically.
Flex + Bison, for example, let you identify how a language is to be interpreted and bison allows you to talk about the *grammar* of that language.
Flex would be used to identify the words.
Bison allows you to define a basic sentence as { SUBJECT VERB OBJECT}
Where "SUBJECT" can be wither a NOUN, PRONOUN or "ADJECTIVE SUBJECT" }
Which allows recursion and all kinds of coolness.

Or, more accurately, depends on the terminal emulator and shell.
I believe Terminator has theme files you can use.
And yes, ~/.Xresources is a good place to start.
or ~/.Xdefaults

Here's my .bashrc. You might have to modify line 23 a little if you're using Terminator.

By going over and being a dick in front of her.
or some other similar way.
You can also cock block yourself, sort of.
I know a couple of self-sabotagers.
The kind of guys who never get with a girl and intentionally mess up their own chances.
I believe the logic is: You can't fail if you fuck it up on purpose.
Yeah. To actually be a cock block you have to be the 3rd party.
But you see what I mean about self-sabotagers?
everybody must surely know at least one.
xiaobai: It's a defensive thing, right?
Girl can't reject you are make you look like an idiot if you do it yourself?
i knew a guy at university.
Virgin all the way through.
And he would get a chance to tap a girl and be all, like.
I WANT TO SUCK YOUR TITS YOU CAN BE MY MOMMY
To try and make his fridns laugh.
no sex.
So yeah.
Guy wasn't bad looking but he was a self-sabotager.
And he was reasonably normal away from girls.

if you don't like hearing Stallman's opinions spoken aloud then your opinions are simply wrong.
Except by spreading awareness of FOSS's importance and founding the FOSS movement.
I could see how you would think that if you were under-informed.
That sounds liek something an underinformed person would say.
Just admit it: Stallman is right. Non-free software leads to a logical a dead-end in which people become unable to have control of their own devices.
3>opensource
But they do.
He's not ranting or crying. Thoise talsk are meant to introduce people who are otherwise unaware to the FOSS movement.
Fucking hipsters hating on Stallman.
I hate that guy.
Stallman doesn't have the personality to lead a cult.
What he does have, however, is strong and well-thought-out opinions. That's exactly what you *should* be listening to.
Hah.
3>DON'T FORCE YOUR OPINION ON ME MAN WAAAHHHHH
one[coding]: But that doesn't make sense. The FOSS ideals are pretty much the only thing Stallman talks about publicly.

If anything, that article reads to me as a stark example of the dangers of voicing an opinion regarding something you only half understand.
You understand why it's important for peoples words to not be taken out of context or modified and wrongly attributed, right?
That's what the article is about.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CHANNEL!
Yo.
Was just about to go grab a midnight snack. What's up?
should eb able to, copypaste. Let me look for you.
Yeah, there's a function for it.
In C it's gtk_text_view_get_buffer
Oh, you're quite right.
But from a GtkTextBuffer you can get the string.
with gtk_text_buffer_get_text
gtk_text_buffer_get_text returns a gchar*
Which is just a char* with some extra stuff at the end.
I don't understand where you're getting gtkiter from.
char *text = gtk_text_buffer_get_text( gtk_text_view_get_buffer( myTextView ) );
is the ugly but concise way in C.
Or gchar* if you prefer.
No idea how it's wrapped in Python, though.
Looks like your args are a problem.
Looks like your Python function is expecting a gtkiter object in the args.
No idea. That function is correct, though.
You just need to figure out what arguments it wants.
Hey, agaric.
copypaste: There must be an easier way.
agaric: Books?
Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clarke.
It a masterpiece.
copypaste: Looks like the C function needs an iter as well, actually.
agaric: Fucking BRILLIANT choice.
It's a pointer to the part of the text.
So your 0 and 3, for example.
Actually need to be pointers to the beginnign and end of the string you're lookign for.
Man, what a nightmare.
Are you using a textEntry widget?

I wrote some "blog-like" software a while back for a site I had.
Although I never did anything with it.
It was simple enough -- it just grabbed a list of files in a "posts" directory and sorted them into date order.
And then you could view the posts in chunks of, say, 10.
Also, if I remember correctly, I actually named my post files with UNIX time stamps, so alphabetical order sufficed.
It'll just take a few more lines of code to sort them into date order.
The only trouble is that modified files will bump the post.
I think it depends on the filesystem.

No, it's not.

yeah, I'm on nouveau right now.
Made them.
With the possible exception of the silver discs.
Which were modified with blue lights.
It actually got a lot better.
I added a score system up the top right and basic level XML files.
And a random mode that just spawned shit forever and got progressively harder.
I know. Bad design choice, right?
XNA mixes really tightly with XMl, though.
So it was a good design choice. Ish.
I lost the coede a long time ago, though. I was just saying I wish I still had it.
Looking at the screenshot, I'm fairly happy with how tidy the code looked, although it's too blurry to understand any of it.

David|whirl: Really?
Wait... you're not the guy who posted the video are you?
riffwuh: yes, he answers pretty much everything.
That video's fucking HILARIOUS.
I entered into correspondence with a bunch of the Firefox fork guys a while back to expose just how much of a change to the codebase they were making.
David|whirl: No thanks. <3
I didn't bother writing it all up, though. It was pretty boring.
Basically no changes whatsoever.
Swiftfox, Palemoon, Blackbird etc. etc.
I requested source for all of them and got fobbed off each time.
Because they weren't actually making any changes.
riffwuh: Yeah -- compiler flags and default settings.
Every last one of them said their version had no actual code changes.
tetsuo42: I know, right?
The email basically just stated simply "Hey, <browser name> developer. I recently downloaded a copy of <browser name> and would like to have access to the source code to make changes. If you've made any changes to the browser's source code then I'll need to get the sources from you. Please reply at your convenience."
None of them wanted to reveal their magic compiler flag recipes, though.
I also emailed to explain that I wanted to publish an article listing Firefox forks and amount of code changed / other optimisations and be able to compile and compare binaries to be sure that I wasn't misleading people.
At which point they all became pretty unhelpful.
I was just looking for that, actually.
The reason I listed Pale Moon first was because the correspondence with the dev was the most memorable.
You may also notice that that page is relatively new.
I believe Firefox was still in version 2.x when I sent the emails.

OK, so there are less clever hacks and people working for the good of the community and more people writien ENTERPRISE QUALITY software.
Regardless, I don't think the morals that surround the FSF have suddenly changed because we have more Java and C# developers. Stallman's point is just as good as it was when he was writing Emacs.
Sure, he does. Just look at his website or the FSF's website.
The FSF are constantly doing anti-DRM or other nastiness campaigns targeted at specific platforms.
There are several texts on why that freedom is important.
So your actual problem is with the FSF's choice of campaign names?
I don't think they're being unpragmatic.
They're campaigning for people to reject non-free software in general and specific pieces of consumer tech individually because they don't respect the users' freedoms.
And those freedoms are important for well documented reasons.
Working on some web dev stuff, chown?
I started work on a pdf viewer in the middle of the night last night.
Share?
Typical web dev, then.
vertevero: There's tons about this on the FSF website. The point is to avoid a class-based system and having the masses placed into a position of helplessness.
Sure is.
chown: I can't find an article about that. Link?
Licensed games are actually bullshit, though.
3>You do not own the games you buy:"The Steam Software is licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Steam Software."
DRM is only enforcable with non-free software.
Hating on Stallman is very in-vogue right now.
I'm sure the guys on /g/ will be happy to hear your opinions.
Read "the Right To Read".
Stallman also has several essays on the consumer-producer divide. It's why he dislikes computer users being called "consumers."
Because of the polarising effect of non-free software.
Hey, tetsuo42.
vertevero: Do you understand why monopoly is bad?
Surely you can see that the logical conclusion to non-free software is full acceptance or full rejection?
Ah, I get it.
You don't see the big picture behind software politics.
If one or a handful of companies are able to control the computing environment then they will use their influence to stifle communal innovation in order to allow themselves to make more money for less work.
But then with FOSS you can't have such abuses.
Bull.
Only in LAWLMURKA
Every other civilised country but Japan doesn't have software patents.
Because corporations are lobbying for them everywhere.
Which is extremely dangerous.
Only in LAWLMURKA right now.
But threatening to affect FOSS elsewhere.
So FOSS only suffers from software patents in LAWLMURKA.
But they are an issue globally.
So... what's your point again?
That you like FOSS and the FSF but think Stallman is "out of touch?"
My general experience is that Stallman is incredibly well-informed and up-to-date on important issues. It makes no difference if he hasn't had any major projects for a while.
vertevero: Because they're only possible with non-free programs!
Seriously. Stop that bullshit.
It's not.
Because there is no murder-free alternative to creatures.
Yes, there is.
FOSS and the rehection of software patents does the trick.
But not allowing them in your country.
Like everywhere but Murka and Japan.
Then we take another step into software monopoly.
Hey, WindowsME.
Learnt to program, yet?
Free software prevents monopoly.
if FOSS was ubiquitous then monopoly would be impossible.
The FSF is against patents.
Just listen to them.
Then what do you want me to say?
Stallman agrees with the FSF...
I don't understand why I'm explaining the FSF's goals to you if you agree with them.
Free software is one component of a monopoly-free software environment along with the rejection of software patents. It's also the only way to ensure that nobody suffers subjugation in their computing.
ACTION sighs
vertevero: Because that part isn't a minor abuse.
I would literally rather you use non-free software than continue to explain. It's been an hour.
It's also minor, in amount, to all of the potential malware you can get from non-free programs.
Which is minor, in amount, to all the harm that can be done by non-free software.
Nuclear bombs can potentially explode.
I wouldn't want one in my house.
So, what's the guess on this guy?
GETOUT, nand or learningcode?
OK, so, long story short: read for yourself the benefits of FOSS, which you already agree with, if you want.
It's not my job to convince you.
I'll talk about it for a while but this has gone on far too long.
I don't mind.

rfw: What's your github name?
Not sure if I have gentoomen admin rights or not.
Yeah, no admin for me.
chown and agaric probably can add you.
Might have to get you to look at my file IO in a minute.
Done everythign else but can't seem to get the images to write to their files properly.
http://ompldr.org/vYzRyaQ
OK.
The main problem is that the output from curl isn't quite right, though.
The pictures are showing up as garbage data.
No, willy_suspension.
Curl needs a write function to write to a file.
so that data is used.
Ah, OK.
So you mean I can use mapM_ and forget the list of IOs.
I'm not too worried about all that right now, though.
I'm more concerned about gettign my write function to write properly.
And can clean it up later.
Aaahhhhhh!!!!!
I just figured it out!
The write function is called in chunks.
3>mfw not settign binary mode on file output!
Went away and had breakfast, came back and solved it.
Boom.
http://ompldr.org/vYzRzaA
http://ompldr.org/vYzRzaQ
2nd one.
Pushed to the toolbox.
Need to add our standard set of args.
But that can wait until later.
... and collision checking.
noclobber
I'm taking a break, willy_suspension.
This is where I'm leaving it for the afternoon: http://ompldr.org/vYzRzaQ
Looks good, willy_suspension. I'll push that version.
Feel free to grab the git and I'll get you added to the access list at some point.
github.com/gentoomen
4chantoolbox repo
Oh, slight problem.
The version you modified was the one that wasn't writing properly.
I'll merge the two when I get a minute.
Haskell implementation of the scraper.
Like a baws.
Because _somebody's_ got to do some coding around here!
<3
He won't write shit.
Not even as a joke.
Does he even use GNU+Linux?
I actually think he may be a Windows user.
Hrm.
3>mfw my initial reaction to the phrase "his Esperanto software" was to assume he wrote it
dwm's brilliant.
Probably the only window manager 9other than my own) that I actually really like using.
xmonad is OK.
Babby's first tiling wm
Simple like how?
I mean... as far as I know xmonad actually has less to it.
No toolbar, even.
As a separate program.
I'd rather recompile once than have an embedded Lua interpreter.
make ; sudo make install
What?
Oh, it's because binary mode wasn't set on the output.
Works for me.
http://ompldr.org/vYzR0eQ
You definitely have the most recent version and it's definitely setting binary mode?
willy_suspension: Do you know how to define yoru args in Prelude?
Annoying.
You're runnign an svn version of GHC?
GHc in the Arch repos is 7.0.3
Oh, this is how you handle args
:main arg1 arg2
Another quick push to the repo.
None, really.
Feel free to remove it if you want to.
It was just put in when I was writing the regex.
http://ompldr.org/vYzR1OA
Another push.
I really don't understand why the files are garbage for you.
3>mfw I was leaving the files open
3>js game engine
Pass.
willy_suspension: Actually, some of my files haven't downloaded properly either.
ls
oops.
I'll deal with it later. I've pushed my changes and now I need to go to the police station and file a police report.
Because a nigger stole my bike.
I think it might be to do with maximum string length.
Havign a callback write function might fix it.
A nigger actually stole my bike, though.
That's the worst thing about it.,
It was a nigger
I just know it.
Callback function seems to have fuixed it.
But made the code messy.
OK, pushing to the repo now, willy_suspension.
willy_suspension: Because it can be elaborated on with output ticking over to show the download progress etc.
How can technology help me become a vigilante bike-stealing-nigger killer?
Nope.
Seriously considering buying one and then gettign a cheap bike and baiting them, though.
PROTIP: it doesn't break down because of the sodium content.
Even the lettuce is coated in salty water.
Salt is a preservative.
It's why cured meat doesn't go bad.
3>Using pre-release software
3>Complaining when it doesn't work
I would play Minecraft if it was FOSS and written in C.
Hey, willy_suspension: The version with a callback function didn't work for you?
That version is huge.
Hrm.
3>mfw I can't test it because 4chan is down AGAIN
Irrlicht looks interesting.
3>This page (http://boards.4chan.org/b/) is currently offline. However, because the site uses CloudFlare's Always Online™ technology you can continue to surf a snapshot of the site.

Boards other than /b/ don't work at all.
Fuck it.
willy_suspension: Has anybody given you write access yet?
3>mfw willy_suspension has been working on this all day
I'm not sure who's an admin on the gentoomen account.
But I suspect chown and agaric.
But that's no the correct way to handle this anyway.
The correct thing is to fork and make a merge request.
And I'll merge your changes in.
3?mfw I have to manually merge
Changes in Scraper.hs
Merged.
We shouldn't really be including that Download.hs file.
3>mfw I think my favourite version is the Perl one.

I fucking hate Eric S. raymond.
M-x tetris
Also, no idea.

Emacs is... OK, I guess.
The fact is that it's a 35MB download. That should ring some instant alarm bells.
Vim is 2.5MB
chown: Colour terminal.
Sounds like fun.
Just use a colour selector to get the colours and modify a theme.
Knickers
Hey, chown.
rfw_: Alarmingly true.
He got really famous about the time The X-Files got big.
Darkness Comes and Mr. Murder were good.
You know what I hate in modern RPGs?
"Kill X-many Ys" quests.
A huge amount.
And since most RPGs are at least a little bit influenced by it...
Skyrim is even more boring. ;_;
Same.
I did briefly consider just ditching all the side quests and getting on with it.
But I can't be bothered.
Did you play Oblivion and Morrowind?
Think of it this way:
People who played Morrowind got sick of Oblivion really fuckign quickly.
I'm one of those people.
People wh oplayed Oblivion got sick of Skyrim really quickly.
Because Bethesda haven't fixed any of the real problems with the games.
Which is that they're huge and boring.
Hey, auREAX.
Not bad.
Thinking about starting a project with Irrlicht.
Man.
I actually quite like irrlicht.
Managed to find an awesome book on it.
http://ompldr.org/vYzdrOQ
I've used a bunch of 3d libs in my time.
This one does things *right*.
So just use C++?
It's probably the best tool for the job anyway.
I really don't think it's as difficult as you think it is.
http://ompldr.org/vYzdrZA
Which server?
Also, source control mang.
Roll back.
chown: What's up?
What about if you want to/have to work in an environment without KDE?
vim-project
Although I don't use it.
I did use SessionMan for a while.
You guys ever play Wetrix?
Fucking GREAT game.
Ogre3d wasn't great.
Haven't used it in years, though.
And didn't use it much when I did. I just remember feeling like I was fighting against my natural way of working ot use it.
But that's fine.
Irrlicht is rendering only as well.
Accessing elements of a struct or class pointer.

chown: Prepare flash cards
rfw: I don't idle there but I visit maybe every other day for some reason or other.
Do tell more.
3>mfw I hate C++
Fucking
virtual

The wiki page descirbes it the best I've seen.
Pure virtual means it actually doesn't exist in the base case.
And *has* to be overridden.
Simple enough. Gets abused a bit, though.
Hey, chown, #/g/sicp is over a year old now.
How much do you feel you've learnt in the last year?
Hate
C++
I've got a brilliant book for Irrlicht here.
But I'm on chapter 8 and so far 2 chapters have been spent explaining how to use non-free pay-to-use software withthe engine.

Yeah, it's actually quite nice ot use.

I LIEK C
Think of it as a simple replacement macro, MileyRay.
rfw: He doesn't understand dynamic memory management, so it's best he sees how to do it liek this first.
MileyRay: What a #define does is a timple text replacement before compile.
So everywhere BUF is is replaced with the number 256.
It's just tidier.
3>mfw this is exactly why people should learn C first.
MileyRay: You're clearly a beginner. I don't think anybody's going to blame you for making noobish mistakes.
Looks fairly standard as a first program, MileyRay.
Looks fairly standard as a college assignment, too.
Although I really hate that they teach such basic stuff at college level.
This kind of thing should be taught in highschool at the latest.
And _everyone_ should learn to program.
You don't need an actual degree to read K&R C and then teach it.
Or a simple smattering of Python for the retards.
And MileyRay; some people don't get it because they don't care. Those people exist in all fields of study.
I'd love to teach programmign at highschool.
My friend is a teacher. We often have discussions about the problems with school IT.
Dutchie: Because it's a basic skill everybody should know.
Dutchie: It's a fucking skill everybody should have. Computers govern everythign and are everywhere and being able to use one makes you better at pretty much any task you wish to excel at.
If you can't write your own software or automate then you can't excel.
In your (wrong) opinion.
Laying bricks isn't excelling.
And there's a difference between what is needed as a baseline and what is needed to excel.
3>not everyone wants or can excel
They should still be equipped with the tools to in schools.
Same.
Maths is boring enough anyway. I very much remember doing the same thing year after year after year.
Dutchie: But they're not cops or painters. they're children.
And they need a good base in everything.

Not everyoen wants to learn algebra either.
My teacher friend is a religious education teacher.

As far as books go, though, I don't think Java is best learned from a book. I think it's best learned from being used.

In fact, the last I heard Taiwan spent 20 years fighting to be independent and China say they won't let them because Taiwan make al lthe money.
Also it's Ironic because Chinese people worked for Apple and died.
And Steve Jobs was the Apple guy who died and his favourite food was Chinese.

Also, I was right: Foxconn is in Taiwan.
Or headquartered in Taiwan.
Apparently they have factories in mainland China, too.

I have a funny feeling Apple's software distribution model doesn't allow it.
Apple have explicit rules against _any_ GPLed software.
And I believe that's because the GPL is incompatible with the distribution model.
Because you can't run modified versions.
The same problem that was had with TiVo.
What's the point of providing source if you're not going to allow people to modify it and run their modified versions?
It was a technical loophole in the GPLv2 that was exploited.

Think of it this way: Any value but 0 is considered to be boolean true.

If the function is called info_valid() then it shoudl return a non-zero value for success.
Generally speaking.
So that you can then do

Sorry, I'm also working on another little niggling bug while I do this.
I think sscanf will suffice.
Ah yeah.
The problem with Uint32 is endianness.
But it works for me and I can't be bothered to accomodate.
For SDL's bitmask.
It's possible to get your a/r/g/b channels mixed up across systems, apparently.
Which is why SDL has a pixelformat struct.

It's actually a deceptive hack again.
As I'm prone to writing.
It doesn't work like you might expect. It actually works on a room-to-room system.
Room potentially has up to 4 exits.
Each exit is a corridor that leads to another room.
Recursively generated.
Corridors are only added to previous rooms if the room at the end will fit on the map, else it's scrapped.
Sounds boring.
Although, having said that, the algo is separate from the drawing.

Does Visual Studio handle conditional breakpoints at all?
It's something I've found myself using increasingly often as of later and somehting I never did with VS.
I find it best for debugging functions.

People talk about the VS debugger quite a lot. I get the impression from these people that they've never used anything else much, though.
I was looking into jdb recently.
Live debugging is nice.
Except I think people assume that Eclipse is the only way to do so.

With a CC-NonCommercial license and copyrighted art assets game development would be exactly the same.

Yeah. Strangely there's nothign really likable about github's UI.
I think my problem is that I approach web design like a software developer.

And I think a big part of web design is just using what works even though it's awful to do so.
Little things like trying to be a bit too clever with things.

Why are you beign so uncooperative? We're trying to help you.
Bah. Fix it yourself. PROTIP: 2 breakpoints should tell you everything you need to know.
You don't get any errors with this code? It just doesn't display a sprite?
And your'e checking the return values og loadImage and getBuffer?
Using your debugger; is sprites[0] initialised after you call loadImage ?
Sorry, I mean "derp"
Yeah, I'm grasping at straws. Everythign here looks fine. it's got to be something you haven't posted.
IMG_Load initialises it.
So what's your problem? You can't blit to buffer?
Buffer is initialised fine here.
It must be a proble mwith how you're blitting to it or flipping it to the screen.
It has a width and height, redlizard, but those are ignored in this context I believe.
Ah.
I found it.
man SDL_BlitSurface
Bah. No, tell a lie.
I thought you had your source and destination mixed up.
Yeah, I give up. If you want to post the project I'mm have a look but debugging without a debugger is killing me.
Ah.
OK, so just ass tempRect.w = derp->w ; tempRect.h = derp->h;
add*
redlizard: Godo spot. That's definitely it.
I didn't notice it because I thoguht the source and destination were the other way around.
Code-Zombie: No, they're ignored for the DESTINATION rectangle.
Actually, you'd better set them to 0.
If that behaviour's defined.
Or tempRect.x = derp->w - x;
temprect.y = derp->y - y;
If you're smart.
Put a breakpoint at line 30 and 32 from that code you posted.
See if line 31 initialises it.
if not then you've found your problem.

Teenage girl. Abusive parents. Men are awful. WOMEN CAN BE STRONG.
3>Charity Stratton's bleak childhood is changed for ever when both her parents are killed in a fire. Separated by the authorities from her younger brothers and sister, Charity is sent out to work as a skivvy in a boys' boarding school.
3>Her loneliness and misery are eased when she falls deeply in love with the dashing but fickle sixth-former, Hugh Mainwaring, but when she discovers she is pregnant with Hugh's baby she soon realises just how alone she really is.

o!v gurps
Oops.
Hah.
1) GURPS is fantastic
2) I found a worse YouTube video talking about GURPS than I ever have with tech.
http://youtu.be/1JogSU7JvXU
I watched baout 3 minutes and he still hadn't said what his problem was so I started skipping.
I still don't know. Something about the layout.
This guy reminds me of a mix of Alan Partridge and Ricky Gervais.
Or, rather, David Brent.
naosia: I have seen.
I might wait a few weeks and see peoples' reactions as I'm in no particular rush.
Raspberry Pi.
I don't like being an early adopter with tech.
I'm a Stable Mabel.
Fair point.
Although I just bought tickets to see W.A.S.P. and a couple of tech books.
I like to at least make myself wait a little between purchases so I feel like I'm being frugal.
David^: I'm plannign on using it to stream to replace my LAWLXBOX.
Which works like a giant shitheap.
My 360 is a fucking nightmare always.
LAWL I NEED TO UPDATE
no, I just want to watch a video
LAWL NOEP NEED TO BE SIGNED IN TO USE THESE CODECS
OK, just sign in.
LAWL NOEP NEED OT UPDATE
Sometimes it mysteriously doesn't turn off.
And I have to turn it off at the wall.
Drops WiFi connection randomly.
Shitheap.
Indeed.
if it wasn't for the fact I need it to stream my shit I'd have thrown it out years ago.

At little performance cost.

Nope
Those things SHOULD be third-party.
There was a piece of programmign advice I heard a long time ago...
That basically said.
Impliement it once and then throw that away and write it again.
Genuinely fucking brilliant advice.
I genuinely have no idea where it's from.
But I would like to correctly attribute it in future if anybod yfinds a reference.
That's the one.

Nope.

Changed defaults so that people won't be freaked out by a random giant window.
hey, MileyRay.
It's handled recursively as soon as the first room is created.
Which is in the Map class's constructor.
map.cpp
Not at all.
Keep me informed -- I'd like to see what you do with it.
There's always a down stair.
The only thing that's a slight problem is a one-room scenareo.
Which I'm just fixing now.
I don't know abotu svn.
But I believe so.
Pushed the change, Trev.
map.cpp lines 27-31 inserted anywhere with map.hpp included should produce full maps.
with room.hpp included*
Yes.
Mostly in/out inventory sounds and attack sounds.
I'm not plannign to include any animation.
Maybe a tiny bit in combat.
but it's low on the priority list.
I already feel guilty for being more graphically bloated than most roguelikes.

Yo, Manhose_.
Hardly.
It was just some experimenting.
The only interesting project I've been working on recently is AxRog.
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/AxRog/raw/master/screenshot.png
inorite.png
I don't think so.
If anything I'm thinking about ditching C++ entirely.
I just wanted to do a project in it so that nobody had any recourse to claim I can't use it.
Manhose_: Because those are details.
1) Get shit working
2) Care about what's public and private
C++ focus on safety is a burden.
Until a project is mature.
Genuinely true to a degree, though.
It's all shit that needs to stay out of my way until I want to deal with it.
Hell.
I was on the fence about bothing to even write correct destructors as I went along.
Manhose_: Runs great.
Not really. Valgrind and dbg pretty much make hammering out all of the memory allocation/deallocation later a cinch.
I jus twant to get the frame up and then spend a coupel of hours rounding it off.
Mincraft code happens when you want to write the whole program that way.
Manhose_: Depends on your distro.
I believ it's just sdl and sdl_image
libsdl
libsdl_image ?
libsdl1.2
But being over-cautious is slow.
There's a balance and I'm confident that I'm not over-steppign it by not caring about public/private class variables.
IDGAF about boiler plate.
Do it right yourself or go home and let the computer write the rest of the code for you, too.
PROTIP: The ocmputer isn't really going to write the rest of the code for you.
I wasn't >implying that the computer really was going to write a program to your specifications without any input from you.
Not at all.
Not any mroe than using a macro to make a new set of .cpp/.hpp files with include guards is.
I'm not really interested in smooth transitions or really making a game for other peopel at all.
There's no up/down yet.
Simpel enough to add but I want to get combat working first.
You can build without sdl_ttf.
Just take it out of the makefile.
SDl_TTF was used in the C version and I just left it in the makefile.
it's not used (yet) in the C++ version, but will be.

Not when you literally have no idea what even an integer declaration is going to do in memory and instructions.
With C you can literally see the stack frames being made and the instructions within. You CAN understand what your computer is actually doing when you instruct it.
And then you have your compiler optimise and make it even TIGHTER.
Who knows WHAT the fuck is happening with an interpreted language.
Being free of HAVINg to know is nice, but with it goes the elegance.
don't get me wrong. I love interpreted languages too.

I disagree and think if you think that you don't know how to use your tools properly.
And rely upon Eclipse to put them all together for you.

If your'e going to do makefile projects then why bother with Eclipse?
It's just a bloated nuisance.
RAM has access speed, numbnuts.

The answer to "it's bloated" should never be "HURR BUT I HAVE LOTS OF RAM"
You mean like a compiler?
Useless shit.
I don't want my IDE popping up crap while I type.
Your answer always seems to be "well then just disable it."
i disabled all of it.
I used Eclipse quite a lot around 2004-2005.
I ditched it because it was bloated and broken and useless.
You'll grow up and get over it, Manhose_.
You're just a Java newnigger like the rest of the Eclipse users.
I like jdb for live debugging.
Other than that I'm not really interested.
i.e. tech support?
Ah, OK.

ncurses.
Yeah.
I hate that.
It's annoyign when your'e trying to debug, too, so I'll stick a sigterm handler next.
Boom.
You like the line-of-sight handling?
It's a lot computationally cheaper than true LOS but looks close enough to work.
Not really.
But this was a ncie little recursive "lightbeam" hack so I used it.
All of the algos I'd seen in various roguelike dev places seemed way overcomplicated.
Levels are generated as you step into them.
So levels are a stack structure.
Per floor.
Because this way the algo can be a bit more complex and overlap.
I have a really nice list of features that can be added to the generation algo but I just wanted ot get everythign working and reasonably polished before I go back to that way later.
Yeah, it's rare. Most use $PWD or similar for such things.
Maybe somethign along the lines of
get_env("HOME")
print( os.getenv("HOME") .. "MyDir/" )
redlizard: Yes.
I was considering randomly adding others with a small chance, though.
redlizard: No, but you'll never be able to tell.
tripper: Yes.
redlizard: Nope.
Good point.
It's not difficult to have it work that way.
In fact, as levels get revealed that might be a really nice feature to have.
Alright, great, it's added to my todo list.

I wrote an SDL roguelike somewhere around 2005.
But, frankly, the graphical element was boring to implement.
Turn-based?
Roguelikes don't really work in multiplayer.
Because the turns are so short.
Interesting.
I just want a game I, personally, can have fun playing.
And the more I play it the more i can hack into it.
Hopefully it will reach a point of singularity in which it will be fun enough to play and easy enough to add to that I'll keep playing it.
Wouldn't be hard.
All of the drawing is currently handled in one function.
It's something I might look into if the game is ever "finished."
As no roguelike ever is.
Nope.

Stop complaining that it doesn't work, then?
A gnome-shell bug is, to me, the perfect example of why you should make your own desktop environment piecemeal from simple pieces.
You're pretty much at the mercy of GNOME devs to fix it because it's far too huge of a codebase to understand.
And even logging errors is a nightmare,
Still, it could be worse.

I got drunk and ate a burget at my computer a few weeks ago.
My fingers are still getting greasy from typing.
I HATE THIS
wat
You meant literally?
What's wrong with you, boy?
redwire: Hah.
redwire: When I write Lisp I like to remain purely functional as much as possible anyway.
So Haskell is good for me.
As opposed to how I write C++.
Which is liek a functional programmer's nightmare.
I was debugging some code a few months ago.
Function contained a reference to an object
I looked at where the object was initialised.
114 steps down the stack.
TAKE THAT, PURE FUNCTIONS!
Pure functions exist in any language.
The lack of side effects is the defining feature.
Having sdaid that, I think that code may have been const correct, so the functions could have been pure.
redwire: Just for fun, really.
I haven't had any major projects on for a while.
eh. Haskell used to be a shiny beacon of awesomeness to me and now it's lost its luster.
Lisp is more likely.
If only because I'm abotu to start reading up on DSLs and macros.
SteveBallmer: Sure it is.
It's whatever you want ti to be.
Pure functions were pioneeded by Lisp.
I just loved all of the functional stuff.
And then I was all, like, oh... I guess everything interesting I've just learnt is just sort of used to surround procedural code.
No automatic memoization of pure functions.
Although it's reasonably easy to apply, with Lisp it's trivial.
haskell seemed that way.
And then do
And then every Haskell program I looked at with more than a few hundred LOC was infested with it.
Quicklisp is excellent.
I used it to grab some x11 stuff recently.
Skipping ahead of my book a bit.
But if you don't do that you're not doing it right.,
Eh. I'm reading the book properly.
I'm just getting ideas as it goes along and trying things out for myself.
Stuff that hasn't been covered yet.
It's been a long time since I've been excited about a programming book.

You can read them but barely.
Perhaps.
Although you need to be able to read before you can write and all that.
SteveBallmer: You're still missing the "you need to read before" part.
You need to have at least played a few roguelikes to know how they work.
And what features you want and which to replace.
Terry Pratchett put it quite well in regards to writing.
he breaks the rules all the time.
But you should know the rules before you break them else you make crap.
But it's wasted effort.
Study and then create.
Then the creation is worthwhile.
Strawman. Masturbation is not an artistic/creative act.
The same could be said about any art.
Because you want to make it WELL?
Because yo uwant software that actually does a good job?
Do you partake in any form of art other than programming, SteveBallmer?
I think you just don't understand how good art and design happens.
Study FIRST.
Create second.
Semantics.
I kickban for semantics arguments.
... as are arts...
Because you could have learnt what to do and not to do faster by studying your medium.
In fact, without looking at other artists work you'll never get anywhere.

Winfags.
Don't know how to go about bundling it with cygwin.dll
Any Winfag developers with any experience about to offer up solutions?
This isn't the channel to be asking about DERP GUYS WHICH WINDOWS SOFTWARE SHOULD I USE?
It's a dev channel.
Manhose used to handle all of my Windows ports for me. ;_;
I've compiled against cygwin dlls before to get UNIX software to work on Windows.
And I'm vaguely aware of being able to bundle in cygwin1.dll, ncurses.dll etc. etc.
To get everythign to work nicely.
You get to not be a babby.
Short answer: Modularity.
Compiling is exactly the time you don't want hundreds of megs of bloat in memory.
As is debugging.
When the lightweight was is also the more efficient way, only a fool would take the bloated, inefficient way.
The only advantage an IDE has is that you have to invest less time in learning ot use it.
But, then, if you don't like learning to use things efficiently maybe programming isn't for you.
Agreed, redlizard. The later learnign curve more than makes up for the initial investment.
cmcdade: vimtutor
Work through maybe 15 or 30 minutes of that and then just fucking use it.
gVim and Vim are basically identical, although gvim supports nicer colour options.
It also has buttons by default for learnign with, although you really want to turn those off as soon as you don't need them any more.
savior: Escape is used for escape sequences within ncurses so it has a second or two delay after being pressed.
Probably.

There are lots of nice kernels.
Linux just happens to be the one that the vast majority of people contributed to.
Linus' innovation wasn't the kernel, it was the bazaar development model.

The foundation that was built upon by countless others.
It's FOSS and collaborative development that made Linux what it is today.

Hate uncyclopedia.
mutoso: No idea. It was definitely hugely ambitious, though.
Lots of shit that had never been done before.
Wildly experimental.
Stallman isn't particularly known for his wildly experimental software.
It feels more like an MIT hacker project, though.
That depends what you mean by "stuck at that age."
I, personally, have a lot more respect for the idealists than those who become grey-faced businessmen.
Great minds discuss ideas. mediocre minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.
I like what Stallman stands for. I think his philosophy is important.
Because I also see the polarisation in other fields and really don't want that to happen to software.
Polarisation of wealth and market dominance.
Monopolies are the end result of polarisation, yes.
But you don't need a monopoly to make the field incredibly stifling to the individual.
An oligopoly with little headway for new business is just as dangerous.
... or almost as dangerous, should I say.
Because business hates competition.
But the disease, in this case, can be cured by treatign the symptom.
But you're quite correct. "Intellectual Property" laws are completely fucked as well.
So... fight it on EVERY front.

Wayyyyyy too old.
We're on 4.7.0
4.2.1 lacks support for the C++0x stuff I'm using.
clang 3.0 works for me.
Yeah, just update gcc.
There.
I put a note at the top of the readme about using an up-to-date compiler.
P.S. gcc 4.2.1 is 5 years old.

The middle bit is like a real movie!
eax: Go do it somewhere else.
Your'e not getting under my skin. I'm just moderating the channel.
I've found that the best way to use it is to avoid over-engineering.
Just use the basic functions.
I don't even use curses built-in menu functions.
Genuinely getting sick of being killed in my own game.
Balance seems to be about right, though.
Yeah, the potions make it playable.
Game's starting to feel a bit more ocmplete.
The game's easy to hack on.
The last few lines of enemy.hpp have a bunch of enemies you can easily extend, for example.
Modularity is good.
Boilerplate is bad.
Rarrrggggg
I hate C++ but it at least has some situations in which it really is the best choice.
I never feel that way about Java.
Or, rather, the situations in which it would be the best choice are situations that I don't enjoy/want to be in.
Getting paid by the line is one of those.
eax: I write C++ with a heavy C-like leaning.
My pet hate is the "C++ can do everything C can do so it's better!" mindset.
Hah
...
C++ and C ARE alike.
Only if you use all of the cruft.
I've never written a C++ compiler but I'm under the impression the language is a nightmare to parse semantically.
eax: Nope. everythign else works from that automatically.
eax: Level 1 monsters appear on level 1 onwards. Level 2 monsters appear from level 2 onwards etc.
Hah.
You could always play to level 1000...
Although there are 2 parts at which I need to add TTLs so the game will end up in infinite loop as things currently stand from about level 60 onwards.
eax: Also, the enemies need to be in level order.
Basically stuff lower in the list won't appear until stuff higher in the list can spawn.
Which actually gives me an idea...
Little bit of hackery.
The level finds where the highest level monster it shoudl sue is in the array, which is static.
And then just spawns a monster between monster 0 and that one.
static Enemy EnemyList[] = {
 // Monsters
}
Hah.
IDGAF
Might add in a debug console soon.
For things like jumping ot later levels etc.
There, fixed.
TTLs added.
Level 1000 works fine.
http://176.31.81.154/storage/lvl1000.png
As in a door at each end?
That's how corridors work.
Although I might give maybe a 20% chance at each end that there isn't one.
It's all very simple to do.
Just not a priority.
I'm also probably going to randomly add a chance to have living doors as enemies.
TROG door
Probably also going to put in mimic chests.
yeah. all that stuff.
Roguelikes are never FINISHED exactly.
I like that this project will always be hackable for me.
Just added stat tomes ot my todo list.
If you play an elf you can play any class and still have a little bit of magic.
And classes that can't normally do magic that find stat tomes can raise their affinities and slowly do a tiny bit of folk magic.
i.e. I'm starting to actually get to add cool stuff.
Food.
Hate the food system./
Yeah, wishes are fun. I'll add fountains and wishes.
I'm also being a bit strange with equipment.
Basically your character is treated as having standard equipment.
But the items you pick up will provide mods.
It'll go until your computer runs out of memory.
I just ran down 10000 levels and the game was using ~300MB.
of RAM*
You're doing well. I've only really made monsters up to about level 3.
Hah
I completely forgot about trolls!
chown: Great shout.
Once I've dumped in some basic magic I'll start adding in special rooms (including shops).
eax: yeah, I got that.
I'll happily keep that in the game.
Yeah, I'll have you in the game as a troll. It's already added to my enemy ideas list.
Along with the special encounter dwarves.
Oh shit.
It's way later than I thought it was.
'night, all.
Curses and stat tomes added.
Hrm?
Odd.
Do you know how to do a coredump?
I'm assuming segfault or similar.
Can you pastebin the error?
Also,
Why still no GCC?
If you run "ulimit 0" first the program will dump a core file that I can debug.
Tell a lie.
"ulimit -f 100" shoudl suffice.
Core dumps are INCREDIBLY handy for debugging. Everybody should use them.
~/
"~/core" normally
... or in your current working directory?
You might need ot run "ulimit -c unlimited" first.
http://176.31.81.154/storage/vis.png
No idea.
What's your system?
OK, then it could be anything. ;_;
Oh, wait.
You're using the wrong flag.
-c
ulimit -c unlimited
It's the core file size you need ot set higher than 0.
Quite possibly.
Actually, yes -- you did.
Just close the tty session and start again. XD
auREAX: WHY IS STD::LIST DEALLOCATING THE WRONG AMOUNT OF SPACE AND CAUSING ME VALGRIND ERRORS?
a) because C++
http://176.31.81.154/storage/fuckingsepples.png
I can't figure it out.
I guess it's probably just more efficient for C++ to allocate blocks of set sizes.
i.e. 144 instead of 108.
3>mfw I use a smiley once ever and everybody wants to talk about it and not fix my valgrind errors
auREAX: Yes, I believe libstdc++ is the culprit.
YAY
Gosha: I also need your executable to debug from a core file.
But forget about it for now.
So long as you got it built.
What is this you speak of?
Nah. Clang seems to be problematic.
I'll just focus on compatibility with gcc.
And accept that libstdc++ makes Valgrind wib out a bit.
For the sake of efficiency.
Velocity calculations are easy once you know height.
My TODo list is getting longer rather than shorter...
I'm also nearing 4k LOC.
3>Johnson isn't here
I saw.
Hah.
Well, the bad news is I totally changed how monsters and characters level up.
To a mathematically sound model.
Basic stats and HP for monsters are now 20 + 10/lvl
Characters get their edge by usign equipment.
Which is also new.
Yes, I was just looking at that.
I might keey the Xp and To next level i nthe atatus line.
eax: It's the way messages are handled.
Just hit return if you want the status bar redrawn after an action.
WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?
genuinely upset.
Segfault?
Did you get a core dumppppp ?
SIGINT..?
yeah. that'll be why.
Damn. Infinite loop somewhere.
if you run it in GDB next time when you ctrl-c out you can do a backtrace..?
gdb trog
run
And then if you have a problem just ctrl-c and
"backtrace"
And that information is exactly all I need tofix the bug.
What were you doing when you got to the infinite loop?
How odd.
I wonder what it could be.
There are only 3 basic potion types.
Which are obvious.
I'll add in mystery potions later.
Hah.
Do you have a very recent version?
I've been adding to it all day in spurts.
k
Have you found a book yet?
I added a framework for special rooms but only one type currently.
You have the floor level as a percentage chance that the room will be a library.
Oh shit out of potions...
Yeah, definitely.
BALLS
Hah.
Just foudn a tome, too.
I'll be adding in a debugging dialogue shortly, which should be of some help to you.
Although, to be honest, it won't help for infinite loops.
GDB and bakctraces are king there.
I think that's the furthest anybody's ever actually played to.
We have a new record holder!
I'll have to make sure to put that on the death screen so that people can screenshot.
Hah.
All of the classes currently are just fighters.
Until I put magic in there's no reason to differentiate except between maybe the barbarian and thief.
Oh, yes, only fighters and paladins currently get equipped properly as well.
I'm working on it.
tetsuo42: Game I'm working on.
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/TROG
The trouble is that the enemies only go up to level 4 currently.
So anything above about level 4 will be a walkover.
Still no books?
Are you in gdb?
SWEET
yes.
And then just type "ba"
Should give you the stack
Oh, balls.
I think you were going into one of the special rooms I made.
Can you go up to #3 and type "i lo" ?
Type "up" to move up the stack.
yeah.
Not sure if you know how to use gdb already so sorry if I'm patronising you.
OK, maybe up one more level, then?
Damn. Did you compile without debugging symbols?
Yeah. Looks that way.
Damn.
OK, well, that's narrowed it down for me at least.
Can't figure it out. I can't see any of those functions being in an infinite loop.
It looks like you're going to get that error every time you enter a special room, redwire.
I've pushed an attempt at a fix but I doubt it'll work.
You get a message come up with flavour text and the room has special properties.
chown: I might be able to. It depends upon the terminal being used. I'll look into it, though.
As I think you're right -- the game really needs it.
redwire: http://176.31.81.154/storage/special.png
When you did it crashed the game, apparently.
I have a funny feeling it's not my code at all, but how clang has handled the std::list iterator that is causing the infinite loop.
redwire: if you feel like having a play you could change line 140 in level.cpp
To something like "if (rand() % 100 < 50)
"
Which will make 50% of the rooms special rooms.
And you'll probably get a crash right away.
GLANG IS A GODDAMN LIAR
Wait...
Next time you get stuck try just pressing spacebar.
Call it a hunch.
What worked?
redlizard: c++0x assumed cstdlib support, I believe?
redlizard: It's just not drawing a window.
redwire: *
redwire: try adding refresh() at line 311 of gui.cpp ?
Yeah. I'll add a debug dialogue ASAP.
Well, let me get half finished and we can all hack on it.
eax: First things I'll add.
And GrantXP
ullRestore, GrantXP and JumpToLevel on the todo list.
That wouldn't be difficult to do at all.
In fact, I could make it a spell.
redwire: I pushed what I think might be a fix.
Actually, I just updated again real quick.
Went totally overkill to fix it.
bbiab
chown: Some rooms just have a random chance for pillars.
redwire: Is it possible for you to compile with gdb and see if you still have the problem?
bbiab again
chown: Are you able to get a screenshot of that?
because it looks like that may be a problem with std::list again...
Yeah, SIGWINCH isn't handled.
I couldn't seem to get the signal handler to recognise it and it's way back on the todo list.
It does.
redlizard: Yes, I am aware.
I'd save maybe 8 bytes of space per enemy by having a separate type class.
I'll handle it later.
redlizard: gcc and ncurses versions?
I just can't reproduce it.
http://176.31.81.154/storage/book.png
Capital "B" in the centre of a room with 4 pillars.
And a message comes up and says
        "You enter a library whose mouldy shelves are overflowing. In the "
        "centre of the room sits an important-looking book upon a pedestal.";
`
Acute accent.
Top left corner.
Yeah, the special room code for the library also spawns pillars.
you probably just disabled pillars in standard rooms.
it'll be the call for an alert when a special room is shown.
That's a definite.
redlizard: Are you able to compile with up-to-date ncurses and gcc and confirm the bug?
Like gcc 4.7.0 and ncurses 5.9
Jambato: Change it if you don't like it.
It's there because escape is handled badly in ncurses.
Because it's used for escape characters.
So it's backtick of wait a second or two after pressing escape every time.
redlizard: I seriously think it might just be that the window isn't drawing.
If it happens again try pressing spacebar?
It's supposed to pop up an alert with a "press spacebar" message and then continue.
Yup.
Ahhhhh
No, wait, no idea.
redlizard: Yeah, go ahead.
Jambato: The fighter and paladin are the only classes with equipment right now.
Equipment doesn't spawn randomly yet.
redlizard: It's just waiting for you to press spacebar.
Jambato: Barbarians don't start with gear yet.
I'll get the rest of the classes equipped after I've figured out this bug.
redlizard: Did it continue after you pressed spacebar?
Are you able to show the state of frames #2 and #3 ?
With "i lo" ?
There. Now everybody should start with decent equipment even if you don't choose a supported class.
Which frame is this?
Wait.
Maybe newwin isn't returning a window?
do {
w = newwin ...
} while (!w);
HHH
Shit, I think that's it!
That's a longer fix that I was expecting...
OK, working on a fix.
Double free? When?
Oh, I got it.
redlizard: 
Not really.
Pushed a quick hackish fix for the problem to github, though.
Why not?
3>Making hundreds of copies of the same items
Also because that's a heterogenous list.
I'll come back and fix that alert properly later -- I should really be using a null-terminated char** list of lines for multi-line alerts.
That's the easiest way, at least. Format them when they're coded and keep them fixed-width.
At least we figured out what it was.
But I can't really think because the igrlfriend's pestering me to watch a movie with her.
chown: Obviously.
They're all just given fighter equipment for now.
3>mfw I have to go away just as agaric turns up for his fortnightly vists

Races and classes shoudl all be completely flashed out by tomorrow.

I'm not expecting to have magic done by then, though.
races, classes and items (including item spawns) shoudl eb all done.
Yeah. there is a random element to all characters.
Lines 41 to 55 in character.cpp should explain if you're interested.

The first one sounds too accusatory for you?
~9~3>C is C++ with features missing
C is C++ without the useless "features" that make bad code.
C++: For when bad design is good enough.
The difference between C++ and C with a focus on objects is minimal.
Why not? It's the C++ of web development.
If you think C++ and PHP are anything but hugely important in "the business world" (whatever that is) you're wrong.
3>But never dev anything
Then how do you know what peopel use for dev work?
Probably a bad position to be giving opinions from.
C is a good foundation to have for any programming language that uses C-like syntax.
Or any computer programming, really.
Pointer arithmetic and data structures and abstract enough to be fast to use but low-level enough to allow you to really see what's happening.
It is, for me, the perfect mid-way point between being so low level it's slow to get anything done and so high level you're working from the hugely abstract.
Understanding the heap and stack and understanding pointers are core o the language.
My irssi fag detector just went off.

Man, I should really finish Land Of Lisp sharpish.

Ah, OK.
I don't know it.
I thought that was some funky syntax.
3>[board x y]
This is alien to me.
I can read your code but I can't figure out why it's not working, anyway.
Break it down.
Take out the sane input checking.
Or just change the false to true
That'll let you know if it's the first part messing up.
If nothing else I've found that Lisp deserves love if only for its debugging excellence.
YAY
You've enthused me to go do some more reading.
In bed.
'night, all.
Attack skill.
Strength is opposed by Toughness.
Attack is opposed by Defense.
Magic is opposed by Will.
You can choose to play one, but dwarves will always have 0 MP and 0 MAG.
So they'll suck.
Dwarves might make great paladins.
Because paladin equipment wil focus on magic defense.
In which dwarves excel.
I've been adding in cool little things like that.
I just added a special halfing luck ability for halflings, for example.
Which gives them a 50% chance of completely avoiding any blow that would kill them.
I will be adding alcohol soon.
So that's definitely on the cards.
Although I'm not sure that will be the exact effect.
I'm open to ideas on mechanics for alcohol.
I've already got a very strong idea on how I want to handle magic.
Like.. water?
I'm planning to add water. Lizardmen are the only race to move through it without penalty.
Ah, OK.
Yes, I'll probably add temples with such things as special rooms.
Just added random item spawning.
So, my achievement list for the day.
Classes are all statted properly, races are all statted differently and have unique features, random items now spawn.
Tomorrow I'll add an unequip/equip menu.
And then the game's actually almost playable!
naosia: Infected by what?
Bladerunner, obviously.
This is the kind of thing a debugger is great at solving.
Is there a Go debugger?
I like your splash screen.
How about Gogre ?
I like the splash, anyway.
Go is a bit alien to me but I'm taking a look.
chown: That's actually really cool.
I need a name change, too.
Do you have pointers?
And I assume you can still typecast?
case statements in Go don't need breaks?
Yeah. You basically explicitly state which type to treat the data at the memory location as.
So you do something like
myItem = (Item*) newPotion;
And then you give the item class an enum to let it know what kind of item it is.
And then convert back based upon that when you need it.
Trev: Too much work to do the graphics.
Even piddly little 2d stuff.
ASCII can look really polished with 1/10th of the effort.
Trev: I might pick it (or something similar) up when I'm "finished" with TROG.
Yes.
And it's quite far along.
The only main component that isn't done right now is magic.
The enemies need a little balancing, too, but whatever.
Trev: In the README.
Yeah, most likely.
"Comma at end" errors are bullshit.

I read all the way up to implemenbting the compiler.
And then switched to Land Of Lisp.
It really is a great book.
Hah.

I like your project. <3
khd2--: Why are you /querying me with some stupid pointless project about a stupid pointless cartoon show?
thetooth: The class doesn't get destroyed.
An instance of the class aka an object gets destroyed.
You can use static variables to share information between instances of a class if that's what you want to do.
You can also use a different object to keep whatever settings you want and then pass that object between instances of the class.
Whatever makes the most design sense for you.
I won't even read it. It's like asking Homer Simpson to design you a car.
Sever yourself from the stupidity. Just close the thread and move on with your life.

I'm fairly certain the AIs are supposed to have "personalities" or someshit.
AIs simply can't abstractly sole problems currently.

In fact, any system that takes a question and can return different answers each time or based upon an element of random chance screams of bad design.

Hah. You decided to get your little SICPBot dig in.
Appending a string in BASH.
Anybody knwo hwo to do this?
Lets say I want to use mplayer to play a list of movie files in reverse name order.
Here's how I was going to work it:
Or how I have been working it, rather:
 for f in `ls --color=never -r` ; do mplayer -fs $f; done
Which is terrible.
So I thought I could shove all of the filenames into a string
Having said that.
mplayer `ls --color=never -r`
Would probably work.
The main problem is exiting and the time between file loads.
Which the second one fixes.
Ah, I get you.
Yeah.
I was hoping there was going to be a special operator but that works, too.
+= or := or the like.
Yeah.
BASH documentation is awful.
I should really get aroudn to learnign an ew shell some time.

Oh god Jesus fuck
Hah.
Well, we all start somewhere.
OK, so, what's the problem?
Before 1001 people come in and show you how to do this in a simpler way.
Ah, OK.
I'm finding it very difficult to see how fast or slow this code would be because of the fact that it's a bit of a mess.
But if you want to know a better way to write it I could look at that for you.
OK, I'm going to go and grab a coffee and if nobody's on it by the time I get back I'll help.
np
Before I go, though, I'll say this;
This is a classic example of how something could be made simpler by splitting it into functions.
the horizontal rule and vertical rules split into two different functions is the quickest way.
It's really down to how much you want to make procedural.
Yup.
With the width as arguments.
I actually have a solution if you'd liek to see it.
Or I can hang on to it if you want to give it a shot yourself.
Yeah, best to give it a go yourself.
Here's the link in case you need a reference: http://pastebin.com/4L4VEqtN
I tried to keep as much of your original program as possible but still show you how you can use functions to break up your big ugly blocks of code.
Good man. I'd liek to see how you get on.
iryw: np
You could also change draw_vertical_rule and draw_horizontal rule into a single function that take their two characters as arguents.
Depending upon how comfortable you are with that, of course. Soemtimes it's better to repeat yourself and be clear than aim for minim code and be unclear.

mb0742: I think you have me confused with WindowsNME
Hah.
Lisp is wonderful for such things.
But then, the mroe I use it, the more I think it's wonder for a LOT of things.
Hrm...
How so?
Nope. Hate javascript.
I use it as little as possible.
Hrm.
I don't necessarily think it's a workaround.
It's just a different method.
In many cases the functional way is much more expressive.
Maybe with jquery.
But look at Haskell.
The upshot is higher-order functions and some really interesting abilityto express ideas with very little code.
Do you have a favourite functional language?
Same.
But of all the functional languages it's probably the most initially convoluted for doing simple things like loops.
Agree.
Haskell is beautiful until you learn do syntax.
And then realise that 90% of the programs written in it are do syntax.
No matter what I do.
No matter the language I use.
It's normally only a few days before I start to miss C.
rfw: How well do you know Haskell?
You get to elarn all of this cool purely functional stuff first and it's quite easy to get excited by the language.
And the do syntax is just a bit of a let-down.
It's necessary, but it's still like plain old imperical logic suddenly is back in your life and all the cool purely functional stuff is suddenly sidelined.
1 sec phone
Yeah, I understand do syntax, why it's necessary and how to use it.
It's just that it sort of rained on my purely functional "oh wow new ways to do things" parade.
Just because it's very familiar.
Yeah, I finished Learn You a Haskell some time back.
I could probably write most anything I could write in C with Haskell if I wanted to.
I just don't particularly feel the need to.
I'll force myself to sometime.
^
3>Mention Haskell
3>t-minut 5 minutes before peopel start posting jibberish Haskell code.
I have noticed that Haskell tends to create advocates very easily.
Probably equal parts people who actually appreciate the language and alternative language cred.
But I do appreciate the language.
willy_suspension: I'm not so much sayign that people would love Haskell and not know it.
But that advocating an alternative language is something hipstars want to associate with.
Not saying that you're a hipster, of course.
But that it applies to all languages to some degree.
The more alternative, the mroe alternative cred and the more people you find advocating it.
I'm probably going to upset rfw by saying that Ruby is another example of that.
Hah.
Regardless of the merits of the language.
because as far as I can tell Ruby is very interesting.
I VERY rarely find myself writing a high-level language for any considerable amount of time.
I normally whip up a quick hack very fast if that's all I need.
Or I write it properly in C.
willy_suspension: I might take a look.
Although right now I'm looking at Lisp DSLs.
Which seem greta for web work.
Apparently great.
Although I'm not up to the chapter on concurrency.
But I imagine it's as ridiculously simple as with Haskell.
Lisp's macros let you make the language syntax whatever you want.
So calling external languages or including new syntax is easy as you'll find anywhere.
Quasiquoted languages are analogous to DSLs.
Domain Specific Languages.
That you can fairly easily write yourself.

You know what I don't get?
I learnt GNU+Linux by myself back when it was difficult.
Because it was fun.
Now it's incredibly easy and people are constantly asking for help.
People with the wrong attitude to learning.
But there's no difference in goals.
These questions could be answered by a Google search.
Its' their method that's wrong.
But that goal doesn't mean that you should want to anything but look up the answers yourself.
Which is quicker and easier.
one[coding]: Sure.
But the people learnign GNU+Linux now are the idiots who don't Google obvious things.
And I think that's about mindset.
And I find people who won't help themselves incredibly annoying.
No, it's not anythign new.
but it's slowly becoming endemic with GNU+Linux.
It's a clash of two cultures.
GNU+Linux already has an established userbase of (semi-) competent self-researchers.
As time goes on more people with an awful mindset come on board and ask for help.
I've always been of the mindset that you can't help people who won't help themselves.
So yes, I tell them to RTFM or Google it.
But these people always feel victimised by such an answer.
So there we have a clash of two, if not cultures, then mindsets.
I tech support once if they'll listen to me explain what I'm doign and why.
I don't tech support twice.
Or who are fine to have their machine be an appliance.

Which is that it's a good opportunity for him to learn himself.
And get rTorrent working how HE wants it to.
tab: Yes, that's effectively what he was saying.
Annoyingly, I closed the window and my queries aren't logged.
Sure.
Yesterday is when my /q  buffer was opened up.
Don't know what his motivation is beyond "I want to ruin µTorrent"
Just never felt the need to.
I don't really care about channel logs either.
I only use them to find out why I was highlighted if I've been away.
Hey, ttiewinwt -- the newcomers message is more skewed towards complete programming newbs who tend to come to the channel and ask how to get started programming.

Link to the games you guys are working on for Ludum Dare?
Games look good this time around.
3>This worlds obsession with binaries
Invent a new kind of computer, then.
Even in a quantum computer everythign would be reducable to binary.
In quantum computing the idea is to give each "bit" a potentially unlimited number of states.
But you can still reduce that complexity down to binary.
i.e. it doesn't matter how the data is really stored or handled (look at SSDs) -- the only way to talk uniformly about data is to handle it in binary format.
It's really not.
The physics is irrelevant.
But that's IRRELEVANT.
The only universal way to handle data is in binary form.
Thank fuck redlizard gets it.
Hah.
So
A quantum computer than can have, say, 32 states rather than 2.
How will an instruction for that processor be stored?
PROTIP: it's like this 00000
Or 01011
Your hard drive can't store data like that.
But that's IRRELEVANT
Because all of the components of a computer use data in different ways.
Binary is the universal abstraction you use to talk about data passing between them.
redlizard: I already mentioned SSDs.
Which do exactly that.
But we STILL sue binary to describe that data because it's the only universal way to describe it.
But nobody would use trinary because it's much harder to work with.
Hah.

3>Supporting oppressive non-free software developers
We don't have to argue about it.
I just don't understand why you would pay somebody to not respect your freedom.
You don't have to bite. I think I've made my point pretty clear.
I'd rather pay the Vim developers and have my freedom than be coerced into payment by a piece of software that I never own.
... or support such practises with money.
3>Letting people tell you what to do with your computer
It's not exactly autism for a programmer to want to use software with source available.
And to be able to do all the things you SHOULD be able to do with the software.
Library code is essential to be FOSS. if it's not then we've building a house on sand.
And what will you do if the developer of ST2 stops supporting it?
or brings in features that you don't like?
Or jacks up the price?
Includes invasive DRM?
auREAX: No more so than mentioning that piece of software.
Or advocating it.
Not everybod ycares about anti-slavery laws.
They're still important.
Except it's not. It's an analogy.
Of course it does.
You  think peopel should be free to restrict others.
I say they shouldn't.
Not everybody supports that freedom.
auREAX: FOR NOW.
Hae: FOR _NOW_.
If Microsoft and Apple had their way we'd be working inside of a walled garden and need permission for everything.
Hae: Supporting FOSS is supporting a move away from corporate superpowers.
Non-fere software like ST2 takes away that support.
auREAX: You're an idiot if you don't think abotu what your actions mean for the future.
Which I suspect you are.
Also, that's a strawman.
Because you're misrepresenting my position.
auREAX: The ACTUAL ARGUMENT is that you need to think abotu the future.
Not claim it's a "sliding scale" argument whenever somebody says that it's important to keep control with the community rather than non-free software vendors.
Hae: Except Microsoft sort of do.
As woudl Apple if they could.
Hae: Buy a netbook.
Now buy a netbook without Windows.
auREAX: It's not a fallacy to acknowledge that when the middle ground CAN BE LOST and that you're allowign that.
Hae: Try it. See how far you get.
I am.
Because as long as there is a contested middle ground there will always be the chance that it can swing to hoarders and then we can never get it back.
auREAX: Straw man.
With software, I say you need to pick a side. Political agnosticism is a win for the oppressors.
And yes, I'd rather control be in the hands of the community rather than the hands of oppressors.
auREAX: Not fucking likely.
Stop supporting oppressors.
Bah.
auREAX: That's not autism.
If you're politically passionate you SHOULD speak up about your opinions.
Trev: Tolerence is just another way of saying "let me have my convenience even if you disagree with ti."
And losing freedom for convenience is endemic in the tech world.
Trev: Except it *is* forced upon a person to a degree.
auREAX, Hae: Everybody in the world sees things subjectively and tries to be as objective as possible. That's the human condition.
Having a strong opinion has nothing to do with that.
Although I think "freedom for the masses is good" is a more objective opinion than "I'm not going to think about the consequences of using this software"
because your'e obviously not thinking abotu the future if you continue to support non-free software.
There's nothing wrong with GMO food.
But your'e clearly accepting that GMO crops have caused a huge "intellectual property" problem within the inductry.
As non-free software would within the software inductry if enough people became reliant upon it.
GMO crops are not, in themselves, wrong.
Restrictive contracts and the bullshit pulled by Monsanto IS wrong.
But you're now arguing my point for me.
"Intellectual property" leads to monopoly.
If I was a farmer I'd be actively fighting it.
As it is, I'm a programmer.
I *am* actively against genetic patents.
And terminator genes.
And?
So the number of people whoi can fight them and the effects of those people fighting back are different.
But the oppression and danger is the same.
Now tell me I'm making a slippery slope argument and that Monsanto aren't totally dominating the American food industry.
Hae: But I am consistent. I already said that I actively oppose genetic patents.
YOU're not being consistent by saying that what Monsanto are doing is bad and then supporting non-free software.
You support the Monsanto monopoly?
In my country, where I have a vote, genetic patents are not accepted.
In my city, where I have a vote, the Green party have 40% of seats on the city council.
Hae: That's the typical "but I can't make a difference" defeatist attitude.
You're on a channel about programming. Use FOSS!
Hae: The Green party have done an excellent job here.
Norwich is a beautiful and well-run city.
Hae: FOSS works great on the desktop.
It sounds like you're making excuses to be lazy and not learn how to use it.
HOW WILL I FEED MY LITTLE GIRL?
But people use the "it's not better" excuse to not learn how to use it.
Look at nand a year ago.
Hae: The only one of those with any weight is a)
Hah.

51% of GNU+Linux users use Ubuntu.
And 16% use Mint.
Although apparently Arch makes up 15%

So, Petit_Dejeuner
I've seen your hobbies are mainly trolling.
Do you have time to get any programmign in while you're at it?
Any interesting projects?
A github account?
Link? I wanna see if your programming skillz are up there with your trolling skillz.
I dig Conway's Game Of Life.
I normally like ot implement it to learn a new language's basics.
That feel when you're building old versions of gcc because people can't into up-to-date compilers
redwire: I never saw your finished Ludum Dare entry.
Was yours with the wolves and skeletons?
And your sister did your art?
Hah. I dig it.
Some people on github are cool.
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/TROG/issues/9
For every wet fish there's a cool guy who reports bugs and wants to learn how to fix them himself.
Yeah, like you.
Bahahaha
Wait, what?
Seems like a merry string of unfortunate events.
Seen it.
chown: yeah, it's not totally out of the question.
brundlefly: The "sequel" isn't a roguelike.
It's going to be more like Might & Magic in style.
Although I'm going to keep my combat system and apply it to a party combat system.
Petit_Dejeuner: No.
I say "Might & Magic" because most people know it.
The style would actually be more like the old Gold Box games but nobody knwos them.
Sans silly first-person dungeon crawling view.

Glad to see you guys have been busy while I've been asleep.

This gives me a warning. Can anyone explain a better way?

include/spell.hpp:17: warning: ‘Spell::description’ will be initialized after
include/spell.hpp:16: warning:   ‘const char* const Spell::name’
src/spell.cpp:3: warning:   when initialized here
It's not an importan twarning.
But I fucking hate warnings.
WARN ME? BITCH I'M WARNING YOU.
Ahhhhh.
Sorted. Cheers, man.
Function pointers are clearly the most elegant way to handle this.
redlizard: I hate C++ everything.
Functions pointers are just fine.
I don't want to make a million different TYPEs of spell. I just want a spell struct with a function pointer.
OO is overrated.
And this is the perfect example of a time when it would be used despite not really giving any advantage.
What's that got to do with anything?
They'll just call a generic heal function with different potencies.
I'd rather just give each spell its own function.
More readable. More flexible. Less bullshit.
but I'm not implementing it 10 times.
The heal is implemented once.
The spell functions call the generic heal function.
I'd rather do without it.
Sure.
Why's that?
I don't think I'll have time to do it today as I have people coming over in about an hour.
Once I've finished up the spells I just have to add shops.
And then finish up my TODO list.
And the game is "finished."
Sure.
And if you improve it I'll include your changes.
But virtual functions add syntactical complexity that IMO you just don't need.
Hey, redwire.
Not bad indeedily.
Almost sortof finished my game.
Which is nice.
Any of you guys seen the wishmaster movies?
My shopkeeper is going to be a Djinn.
The Shopmaster.
I'll just have him be a "Merchant Djinn" in the game.
And I'll write him up as the Shopmaster in the README.
Why does this ZenitH guy want to change my roguelike so badly?
Or, rather, why does he want to change the combat system to a bland WoW clone?

I thought they might at least appreciate good tech-related concept albums.
Like what Steelwing's doing, 2112 and Operation Mindcrime.
Dem awful structs.
I don't like C++'s style.
.cpp file is cleaner at the expense of making the .hpp file a mess.
I'm angry you're going to make me say something I hate saying.
But it's really down to preference.
C++ just never feels as elegant to me.
Hang on, I just closed the source file.
Let me take another look.
I really don't like forcing OO onto this.
I don't like overloading of havign to use constructors or, indeed, objects for this.
Hrm.
I'd rather stuff the "dice size" into a define.
There are some magic numbers floating about for combat numbers right now.
But that doesn't mean you can't follow good practise and define them in the header.
How so?
But the heal spells use a formula.
It's simply 4 + 1d8 per level of potency
Ah, I see what you mean.
I don't think it really matters. I don't think that information really needs to be seen by people viewing the header.
They just need to see healing spells of increasing strength.
You could stick in a comment if you want.
The mana cost is just there because it has to be defined somewhere.
If I thought it mattered I'd put in a comment.
As it is, knowing which spells are more or less potent and their relative mana costs is enough.
A tuple of lists? What are you talking about?
I don't see that.
Matched pairwise with all the other spell data.
Which is fine. The list is only ever iterated once anyway to create the spellbook.
And the spell's const char* name is used as an identifier to pick it out for use by the character.
Less ugly than making a whole bunch of new structs.
Also, do those need freeing?
Gahhhhh
I assumed that's why you suggested it.
As much as /g/ seems to be under the impression that I just want to brow-beat everybody into doing things MY WAY, I quite like that people have different skills that allow them to reach their goals.
If everybody thought the sameway and used the same tools we'd also all be blind to the same problems.
You have to really just downright respect talent and a will to learn, eh?
Which is why the cardinal sin for me is talking about something you don't have enough knowledge to be talking about.
of course, the average person on /g/ is a talented programmer and highly self-motivated learner.
Which is why /g/ is such a great place.
So.
Petit_Dejouner is still b&?
one[coding]: I don't think so.
"Warring" not so much
But discussing which tools are genuinely good to use is important.
Eh.
I think there's mutual respect amongst the Vim and Emacs users.

Go straight for Common Lisp.

I like Scheme's simplicity.
But I prefer CL's "OK, you know how to program already, we'll come clean with you about letting you handle data like an adult"

I don't liek Ubuntu because it's not a very good distro of GNU+Linux.
Even the minimal edition is bloated and pulls in bloat as you add software.
If you don't care about that then it's perfect for you.
There's a difference between used space and binary bloat, though.
Compiling takes space.
How fuckign slow it runs?
But you said yourself you can get rid of that used space.
Compiling with portage is actually a good way to keep the cruft out.
It's not bloat at all anyway because it's not affecting yoru system's performance.
It's the one-time leftovers from compiling.
Hae: I used to to convince a few people to try Ubuntu, actually.

But I feel like giving one a chance.
This is the channel's chance to convince me modern games aren't all shit.
I want something interesting.
With story and character development and a little bit of action.
I might just play KOTOR.
It's not a great game so I've only played it a little.
Fuck it. I might play Baldur's Gate
For the millionth time.
I don't play terrible games.
Hence, I only play stuff that's 10+ years old.

Never read any of his stuff before.
And I also have Against A Dark Background sitting on my bedside table.
Yeah, you know, I was genuinely really surprised.
Manhose: yes, I have seen.
I'll be doing an update soonish.
Hate Robert Jordan's work.
Got half way through the second book and ditched it.
Jack Vance.
I don't go much in for generic fantasy but Jack Vance is excellent.
Also all of Robert E. Howard's pulpy Solomon Kane stuff is quite good.
Probably Neal Stephenson's Anathem.
genuinely amazing.
Dont' read anythign about it before you start.
Fucking reviews ruin the first 3rd of the book.
Also, don't be put off by all the made-up language.
I was put off by it initially and ditched the book but later you begin to really become engrossed in it.
The language really helps.
Great choice.

Manhose: What are you reading currently?
I was walkign past a market stall the other day and a book caught my eye.
Eon by Greg Bear.
Never heard of him before.
Picked it up and read the back and the dude was being compared to Arthur C. Clarke.
70 pence.
I've never liked George R. r. Martin.
His Twilight Zone episodes were particularly bad.
I don't know hwo you can fuck up The Twilight Zone but he managed it.
Luckily J. Michael Straczinski is awesome and basically wrote the whole 3rd revival season.
Yeah, of course.
It's next on my pile.
Right after I finish Keepers Of The Peace by keith Brooke.
Which is borderline trash.
But I've almost finished it so I may as well see how it ends.
Riz: I don't respect anybody who doesn't.
Manhose: Don't bother looking up the episodes.
Theyr'e awful.
Riz: You should. All the best ideas are expressed in books.
Television in particular begins to appear very shallow if you read.
If your'e not a big reader then short stories are a great way to get yourself addicted.
Try Arthur C. Clarke. He's excellent.
I have this and heartily recommend it: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Collected-Stories-Arthur-Clarke-GOLLANCZ/dp/1857983238/

You really should.
They were huge in the 80s.
And they sound like exactly what you're trying to do.
Kodiak: "Choose your own adventure" is the later version of Fighting Fantasy.
I had a bunch of those, too.
If you make a game like that I'll happily play it.
Not bad.

Actually, I don't think it was.
It was more like RuneQuest.
And the other Chaosium games.
Which one, Trev?
Hah.
I always likes Chaosium's Call Of Cthulhu for that kind of setting.
Trev: How do you feel abotu D&D?
I'm not really into anything later than 2e.
3.5 had some interesting ideas but it's just not the same.
D&D was best when characters took 10 minutes ot make and you could jump right in.
GURPs and HERO are better games with longer character creation.
And D&D tried to copy that.
And stopped being D&D.
I'm really tempted to make a GURPS game.

My first thought was
This 13-year old took a lot of his own time to actually write this.
Good on him.
Even if he doesn't knwo what the fuck he's talking about.
I love how Lisp handles ratios.
No more rounding errors for us!
Which makes it great for calculating probabilities.
(* (/ 5 6) (/ 5 6) (/1 6))
I also like how Common Lisp handles simple iteration as standard.
if I ever use scheme I normally define a 1- and 1+ function early.
I like Haskell.
Hackage makes it more practical than any Lisp I can think of.
Yeah. it's just so alien your skills in other languages don't translate well.
And, hence, you tend to pick what you knwo to get shit done fast.
It can also be hugely ineligant in application.
ghc compiles down Hello World to a 1+MB executable.
redlizard: Perhaps for you.
I've been thinking imperatively for a long time.
And dealing with state.
No, I love recursion.
I've recently begun actively workign towards using less state and keepign my functions pure, though.
If only because I know there's no reason not to.
And it aids debugging and testing no end.
agaric: Have you ever studied maths at any serious level?
recursion is never done more elegantly than in pure maths.
redwire: I don't know everybody's location, but at higher education.
University level.
redwire: Where are you studying?
I think recursive functions were in my first maths module of my first year of university.
agaric: I bet you can see how the recursion can work here.
Annoyingly, I can't think of any good examples off of the top of my head.
redlizard: I was trying to think of a pure maths function.
I'm tryign to think what it was I was doing way back when that made me grok recursive functions.
Oh.
I remember.
It was a module on mathematical modelling.
Population growth.
But yeah, liek redlizard said -- it's really common in maths.
Chapter 10 of Land of Lisp is fuckign excellent.
Simple AI 0-player game where animals run around searching for food and pass on their simple genes to their children.
You could do it in any language but this is exactly the kind of thing that makes a book interesting enough to get through.
redwire: Have you worked with macros in Clojure yet?
;_;
I know that's where the magic is.
Work faster, code monkey!
I can't tell if this book I'm reading is absolute shit or not.
Oh.
It's been released by SF Masterworks.
They're notmally pretty good with picking the fucking HIGHEST quality books.
I wonder if Stallman has ever played Dungeons and Dragons.
I might email him tomorrow and ask.
And to make it a bit more legit I might ask about his opinions on WotC's d20 license (after laying down some explanation just in case).
How do you feel about that statement?
I wrote that.
Wanted to see if you were going to rage or something before I told you.

Which continues to get dumber.
re.match(regex, string) ?
Hah. Same answer.
I've been disatisfied with all browsers for a long time.
And I don't think it's wholly the browser developers faults.
redlizard: I wouldn't know because I don't use the default Firefox interface.

But yes, I often just use surf or luakit.
If I'm on my netbook I won't touch Firefox with a bargepole.

How do you guys feel about copyright terms?
Particularly the "life of the author + 50 years" it currently is in the U.S.?
70 years*
redlizard: Oh, well that's good, then.
Although I do think authors need protection from negative attribution.
Yes, it really is.
Although it's covered by copyright currently.
I'm considering releasing a project that is definitely against copyright law.
And I'm thinking about how best to handle it.
or if I should even talk about it.
A project that would potentially put me in a position to be sued for copyright infringement.
And, realistically, including with the project a document saying that I refuse to accept the terms of copyright law.
Especially as the copyrighted material is 20 years old.
I'm considering releasing it anonymously.
I don't see why not. if it ever got serious enough that IRC logs got pulled up I'm already going to be in deep shit anyway.
And I haven't done anything yet. Just tossing around ideas.
I'm considering writing up the full text of some old Fighting Fantasy books into a game.
A trivial programming task.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Thieves_(gamebook)
Actually, I think Wizard Books is an independent publisher.
Yeah, it is.
An imprint of Icon Books.
Having said that, it would be great to have something distributed anonymously and have WotC get very upset.
And realistically, havign written the software for one would make making more incredibly easy.
It would definitely be possibel to distribute them via torrent.
So what do you think? It's a simple enough little side-project that could potentially get me in a shitload of trouble.
I don't particularly want to hurt Icon books but I doubt any little piece of software would harm their sales (if not improve them).
Really? Like what?
You can /q if you'd prefer.

Not sure what the rules are on gliders.

Well. If I make electronic versions you should play them.
Nope. it's a gamebook?
Ah, OK.
No, I never played it.
I recognise the cover, though.
Ohhh, I have played it actually.
Swinging from chandaliers gives you a bonus to your rolls.
Yeah, I actually has an online game group around 2000-2003.

And a guy ran us through some of this.
For osme reason we've discussed RPG stuff a bunch and I still get surprised when you know about them.
I can barely remember it, but I remember thinking that it was an awesome way to think about the system.
because it made everything like a movie.
Most games think about giving action options to make things movie-like.
This game just cut out the middle man and let you do awesome stuff.

This ZenitH guy added random character name generation to TROG.
It's fairly basic but it's pretty cool.
Just a random guy who started adding to TROG.
He started off annoying because he doesn't seem to be exactly the world's greatest programmer.
But he's picking up all the easy stuff from my TODo list.
All the little bits that make the game feel nice.
Riz: Roguelike.
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/TROG
They're great fun.
Man, I should really update that screenshot.
Oh, don't, that's a massive sore point.
if I was going to write the game now I'd have just used C.
redlizard: Actually, I put it back to how it was.
TROG originally allowed some overlap to make things interesting.
But the algorithm was from a game I made before TROG.
redlizard: yay!
https://github.com/LAMMJohnson/TROG/raw/master/screenshots/screenshot4.png
redlizard: The new old maps?
i.e. without the overlap?
The overlap added spice but made things ugly.
redlizard: OK.
redlizard: If you're using a 16+ colour terminal run trog with the -6 flag to have extra colours enabled.
Manhose: Of course I'm interested.
Oh, I've seen this before.
Yes, this algo is excellent.
I'll add this to my bookmarks and TODO list.
Yeah.
I definitely agree.
More cool ways to randomly generate stuff = better.
Rougelikes are never finished.
redlizard: Press F8 to use the debug console.
LevelUp
You can also give an arg if you want mroe than one level.
redlizard: Yeah, I need to add some links from later rooms to earlier rooms to make things less linear.
But the old way was a bit of a hack and caused ugliness.
I'll add it when I can add it properly.
redlizard: In the map.
Some little niggles that needed fixing.
Opinion very much noted. I'll try and mimic how the maps used to work when I snazz up the algo.
because I do know what you mean -- I left the semi-functioning hack in for so long purely because the maps it made were quite good.
redlizard: Just be careful how you step about.
Don't get surrounded.
Don't drink potions in combat if you can help it because it gives enemies free energy to attack you (equivalent to time)
It's not really really complicated.
What's giving you trouble?
Playing pure combat is purposely very simple.
Classes with a mix of magic will be the ones with real tactical options.
If you can figure out slower enemies' step times you could use that to your advantage.
Bigger stuff and zombies in particular.
Well, those enemies need mroe energy to step.
So every 3rd action or so they'll miss a go.
So you can bait them backwards and get a free hit if you're careful.
Useful if you're in trouble.
i.e. low HP.
However, the exact opposite is true for fast enemies.
So you really just have to plow into rats and the like.
Hah. No.
Although I'm considering using it for smarter enemies later.
Manhose: I'm not intending to work on one.
redlizard: I sucked at prince Of Persia.
Too impatient.
Manhose: When I "finish" TROG I have lots of other stuff I want to work on.
redlizard: Actually, I do remember that.
Manhose: I want to convert a bunch of the old Fighting Fantasy books into games and start work on a "sequel" to TROG more akin to the gold box games.
With fractal terrain, overworld maps and party-based combat.
But TROG needs to be more complete before I start those. I don't want to be leaving tons of half-finished projects lying around.
As one is prone to do.
Hah.
Well, I did the bit I said I was going to do with Dungeon.
Dungeon did genuinely have some potential.
I'm not sure I dig the first-person viewpoint, though.
Although it certainly was easy to implement.
And works for maze-like dungeons.
We did smash out the core of it extremely quickly, though.
And it was pretty fun.
I'd like to collaborate on a game when we both have more time.
And get everybody involved.
Like we had planend to do with Dungeon.
I'm planning to start looking for a stupid boring job in June or July.

I enjoy it too much to spoil it like that.
I've worked with PCBs since I was a kid.
My dad used to have a business making them.
is that the one with larry david?
redlizard: Not exactly. All of my embedded systems work was far too low-level to be considered OS dev.
And I wasn't employed to be a programmer. I was employed to do board layouts.
Nah, I never have. it's on my todo list, though.

VLC might be able to do it.
That was my first thought.
Hah.
Open VLC and then type "open network stream"
And then type "screen://"
It can certainly handle your desktop as a tsream.
You just need to handle the output.
You might be able to capture direct from yoru card depending upon what it is as well.
Looking at how to stream from vlc to Livestream.
you definitely can.
I'd look for you but Livestream seems to be a nightmare to actually get to "let me stream something" modo.
No idea. I don't really do this stuff.
VLC can act as a server, though.
You could just give people your IP address.
http://ompldr.org/vZG5neA
Riz: How to set up a rtsp server in VLC.
Which is what you use to stream video.
I'm fairly certain VLC can just output like it was a camera, too.
You just need to find a site to stream to.
So the problem at this point isn't in streaming with GNU+Linux, it's in finding a host to relay your stream.

HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?
Who's the big trainwreck of a transsexual they have write for them?
Looking her up now.
Hrm.
I'm havign trouble deciding a correct way to design a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure engine.
My initial idea was to treat every entry as a struct with function pointer.
Then to actually just make every entry a function call.
And now I don't know.
Fuck it.
Hrm?
It sounds like how stupid people write code.
I think you're making some incorrect assumptions about how the engine has to work, though.
My other idea was to parse text files.
One for each entry.
The trouble is that I basically have to create a very flexible piece of imperative logic for each entry.
I might fire up flex and yacc.
And it's a good excuse to.
Well, the logic in the book reads imperatively.
"There is a big ogre. if you want to fight it turn to page 22, if you want to sneak past it make a luck check. If you succeed then turn to page 88. if you don't want to make a check or fail go to pare 109."
page*
You see what I mean?
I think text files might be the best way.
Or maybe a Lua interpreter?
There are.
Which is why I considered just making a few standard functions in C and using a struct with the scene info and the choices attached.
Actually, the mroe I think about it the more I think embedding Lua might be a good idea.
redlizard: The choice prevents it from being purely functional.
because side-effects.
I just don't see this being easy to implement in a functional way.
Maybe with higher-order functions, actually.
But it'll still be very complex.
Ah, I see what you mean.
Yes, I was leaning towards a markup language.
But rather than XML I'd probably just write my own parser in flex.
Hrm.
Need to avoid complexity as much as possible.
This is one to ponder on.
redlizard: What's that?
OK.
hrm.
I might look up conversation modellign engines, too.
Like are used in games currently.
Anybody know any good books on embedding lua in C?
I want a nice meaty book to tuck into.
O'Reilly must have something.
I'm taking the extensible path.
And the path that allows people to write up the adventures without much programming knowledge.
Yes.
I want people who use the engine to be able to dump their functions into .lua files and extend the logic to whatever they need.
And I*I* want to be able to do that.
Yes.
I just know these books are going to have a ton of logic I wasn't expecting to see.
And just dumping them into Lua logic is quick and easy.
And I'll have the lua files hook the C functiosn for displaying text etc.
Can NOT find a Lua book relating specifically to using it as an embedded language.
choice and luck_check will probably be written in C.
But i get what you mean.
redlizard: Because there are lots of other pieces of arbitrary logic that can pop up.
There's no reason not to give any arbitrary amount of control to the lua part.
And? All the core stuff will have hooks.
Choices, luck rolls, combat, inventory access.
All defined in C with Lua hooks.
Man,
you sure know how to take the fun out of a project.
I'm going to go get a cup of tea and start hacking.
redlizard: I'm not saying everything can be controlled from Lua. I'm saying that any arbitrary amount of logic can be built on top of the engine for complex decision-making.
That's deep, man.

I hope you enjoy 30 seconds of high followed by an hour-long headache.

In your face, Lua.

http://ompldr.org/vZG9zYQ
And what?
In the words of everybody doing something a bit dodgy ever, "trust me."
Skipepd the Lua part.
Lua code each block of text and put those blocks into a book.
So i skipped that.
Made a big array of function pointers for each book.
Each function pointer is for a section of the etxt.
The functiosn return an int for where to go to next.
And you just dump logic for each block in each function.
Choose Your Own Adventure game book.
To a degree it's similar.

yeah, I've seen it.
Doesn't appeal to me.
Not enough huge arrays of function pointers.
TRUST ME.
Bahahahaha
auREAX: How do you mean?
The books will just call GUI functions askign for a choice.
And then the function return an int for the section to "turn" to.

I live with 2 lesbians currently and I had them in stitches laughing when we watched Philadelphia.
Have you guys seen it?
Or know what it's about?
Tom Hanks plays a gay lawyer with AIDS who gets fired from his law firm and fights a big rights case and then dies.
And there's this big emotional scene at the end and then the credits roll.
And everybody just sat around in silence for a bit.
And I went.
"Wait. Is Tom Hanks the villain?"
rfw_: have you not seen it? I would imagine it's the kind of movie that gay men would relate to.
Not necessarily the AIDS and death
But the biggotry.
Some stuff happens in it that's quite evocative.
Lots of "AIDS IS THE CURE FOR FAGS" posters and stuff like that.
Also it has Antonio Bandearas as Tom Hank's gay lover.
Hanks' *
Yeah.
Denzel's the MAN.
And he's good in that movie.
He has a derp eye.
It's a great movie, anyway. I highly recommend it.
Yeah, but he narrates the newest incarnation of the Twilight Zone so it's OK.
There was this huge thing in the early-to-mid 90s where they made a whole bunch of fucking SERIOUS AS FUCK movies that are amazingly good.
Yeah, I can kinda see that.
I put it in the same league as JFK, The Power Of One, Malcolm X etc. etc.

Either way.

You could use some slightly more comples logic to ensure you do the correct lookup.

Don't be like that, asdfman. People who don't use Vim are people, too.
They're just like us except slower.
Go back to your Quick BASIC.
It's got nothing to do with WPM. It's everything to do with how efficiently you can convert your thoughts into text and how quickly you can modify existing text.
Most people who don't know how to use either Vim or Emacs just go "meh, it's probably not worth the effort to learn."
But, then, they don't know the tools so how could they possibly know?
Allegory of the cave.
Well, as somebody who knows most vanilla IDEs and who bothered to learn to use Vim and Emacs I think they're worth learning.
It's 15 minutes of your time.
I highly doubt that.
I think that's the one thing one should never skimp on; taking time to learn new ways of doing things.
It's the programmer's mindset, I think.
I've had a job in the field of programming.

Go to interesting IRC channels and wait until somebody posts something that you find useful or interesting.

Over the years my preferences have run the gamut from "I like dumb girls" to "I like smart girls" to "fuck it. I like any girl that just doesn't bother me too much."
No.
I've just accepted that women are different to men and that they're not very fun because they have different interests.

Pretty much all of that book is full of cool little guidelines and stories to back them up.

I meant the other "read".
As in a suggestion.
I haven't read TAOCP.
I tend to go for books that are a little more hands-on.
And I'm under the impression TAOCP is a bit more abstract.
Sure.
but sometimes I just want to read a book that tells me how to write compilers.
Bahahaha
Not previously seen in C, pragma met with
some initial resistance from a gcc implementor, who took the "implementation-defined" effect very
literally
in gcc version 1.34, the use of pragma causes the compiler to stop compiling and launch a
computer game instead
The "#pragma" command is specified in the ANSI standard to have an arbitrary implementation-
defined effect. In the GNU C preprocessor, "#pragma" first attempts to run the game "rogue"; if that
fails, it tries to run the game "hack"; if that fails, it tries to run GNU Emacs displaying the Tower of
Hanoi; if that fails, it reports a fatal error. In any case, preprocessing does not continue.
Quirky.
To be fair, though...
Fuck #pragma
Cats are hilarious.
I watched a documentary about octopuses yesterday.
It was really good but the American voice-over guy tried to make it a lot more exciting that it was.
Stupid American documentaries.
He was literally, and I fucking kid you not, going
OCTOPUSSES ARE SO SMART THEY ARE ALIENS HERE ON EARTH IN 100,000 YEARS THEY COULD BE SMART ENOUGH TO INVADE US
It was a good-ish documentary by the Discovery Channel.
It was just so obviously attempting to appeal to Big Joe Dumbshitstein by, yes, sensationalisation.

A bit more American-ish but gets to the point quicker.
yeah.
And it also imitates a cuttlefish.
Tucks all its arms up and swims like them so enemies that don't hunt cuttlefish (because they're too fast) don't go for it.
They also have 9 brains.
One main brain and one at each arm.

"Deep C Secrets"
It's also written with a good eye for humour.
Reviewing areas for improvement is one of the factors that gradually improves the science of software
engineering and the art of programming language design. That's why C++ is so disappointing: it does
nothing to address some of the most fundamental problems in C, and its most important addition
(classes) builds on the deficient C type model.
-- Peter Van Der Linden

Runtime checking goes against the C philosophy that the programmer knows what he or she is doing
and is always right.
A downside is just another way of saying "problem."
Albeit a calculated one.
Sure itis.
because those problems are part of C's standard.
Man, you are the most boring person in the world.

cmd is a single character type.
You need to have space in memory for a string to be placed.
There are two ways.
The first is to make a buffer liek this.
char cmd[100]
That makes space for 100 characters.
scanf can overrun that and it a major security problem, but worry about that later.
np
read K&R C.
The other way is dynamic memory allocation.
Yes.
But juet remember in the back of your mind that scanf can't be used in a safe manner.
just*
Gah
http://ompldr.org/vMnN5bw
That's a warning, not na error.
And it's because you're basically promising it the world but actually only giving it 15 characters.
Don't use scanf.
No problem.
Think of it this way: Each function makes a frame on your stack.
It's like a stack of boxes.
Each box is sized just right depending upon the variables you need for that function.
Your main function gets made with space for 15 characters.
scanf doesn't know anything about yoru silly sizes and doesn't care.
It'll write all over your box if it runs out of space.
Even over the instructions that the box is made of.
people who are acting maliciously can write out of scanf in such a way that your instructions are actually replaced.
With instructiosn that do what they want them to do.
Haeroe: Probably the first compiler writers realised you could do it.
I can see the logic behind it.

I guess the language's designers looksed at Perl and sort of went.

You really shouldn't use scanf.
But I believe this will work;
scanf("%s %s", var1, var2);
But, then, I never sue scanf so I might be mistaken.
fscanf is just like scanf but a bit safer
The problem is more in using them to read in strings.
if you're using %s in scanf you're doing it wrong.
You'd be better off using fgets
fgets (buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);
Welcoem to safe string input.
No, not gets.
gets is unsafe.
Never use gets.
That's a quote from the manpage.

Yeah.,

Luckily as information becomes freed and education becomes better people are just sort of giving up on the silly religion stuff.

Whether you believe in as-yet undiscovered intelligences or forces should have no baring on your life.
if it does, then you're an idiot.
False comfort.
In a forgiving God with magic powers.
So delusion is good if it helps you?
It's instability and it's also extremely harmful.
auREAX_: fairytale gods are delusion. Don't be ridiculous.

Picking whatever suits you to get you through the day is delusion with no basis in fact.
auREAX_: But it's still wrong.
If I work all day believing that when I get home I've probably won the lottery would you go "IT'S HIS RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE HIM WRONG"?
Ridiculous.
I clearly haven't won the lottery. I didn't even buy a ticket.
It's delusion.
And delusion is a state of mind that is associated with being unhinged from reality and can lead to extremely harmful action.
Not until I get home and I haven't won.
Unfortunately most religions put the "you will find out when" after your consciousness is destroyed.
Yes, chown, organised mass delusion is more dangerous than personal delusion.
And mroe wide-spread.

I strongly believe that if you agree to allow chance to make your decisions you should stick to them.

And use it as a way to make a decision before I flip the coin.
If the coin is in flight we obey its wisdom.

I don't think it's better.
In fact, it's an excellent way to make unclear what your compiler is and isn't doing.
3>Hiding __near or __far pointer weirdness: 
3>D doesn't support 16 bit code, mixed pointer sizes, and different kinds of pointers, and so the problem is just irrelevant. 
Hrm.
Whatever they are, I'm fairly certain adding them to C is the solution to a problem nobody needs an answer to.
Stop championing you silly hipster language.
Mixins are appropriate to OO languages.
C isn't an OO language.
You approach to whatever you would apply mixins to will therefore obviously be different.
3>innocuous mad because nobody cares about D
3?>wahhh you are an elitist because you don't like my useless language
You care enough to champion it here.
innocuous: My only problem with your championing of D is that you seemed to want to compare it to C in an inappropriate way
The fact that D has mixins and C does not is completely irrelevant, because C doesn't need mixins to be great at what it does.
3>[20:01]  innocuous: what is achieveable with mixins isn't in C without writing your own preprocessor
Preprocessors allow you to do various magic things without needing a high-level language.
I was tryign to avoid doubling redlizard's effort, but I do agree with him.
Macros are magic.
And a language lacking them is at least a major warning flag.
ACTION sighs
So...
What you're saying is...
That D has macros because you can use a generic preprocessor?
Even then the devs appear to be actively fighting your efforts to do so by providing a semi-complete "D Way".
REPOST
You posted that yesterday.
Actually, 13 hours ago.
I was here.
I enjoyed it.
D'awww.
Poor Stallmanu.
That hardware is extremely difficult to replace.
No.
Nobody would care if *YOU* lost your laptop.
People obviously care if somebody like Stallman does.
Spierek: Completely FOSS, inclusing BIOS and firmware.
No small feat.
Legato: I'm not the person posting the story.
I'm not entirely sure of the model either.
Can anybody remember the site that gives tech personality interviews where they talk baout their hardware and software?
Legato: I'm often accused of not having much empathy.
But I simply don't feel like most people warrant being empathic towards.
Because I think most peoples achievements, opinions and goals are painfully mundane.
Cheers, Legato.
But yes, I think STallman is worth feeling empathy for.
The fucking range of people on that site.
Everything from "Researcher and scientific visualiser (Applied Physics, Harvard)" to "some guy who wrote some of the 'story' for Dead Space"
Legato: It certainly is very OMG SO EDGY to dislike Stallman nowdays.
I'm sure you'll find lots of hipsters to complain to.
CookieJar: 3>People need a way to sustain yourself
The same argument can be applied to any restriuctive endeavour.
The government should grant me a monopoly over whatever I want so that I can make money.,
I need a way to sustain myself.
CookieJar: Don't bother. It's all been said before.
You deserve to be paid to program if somebody wants you to program something.
You don't deserve to maintain monopoly over something you have created and then given to somebody else.

Dawid: The O'Reilly one?
I also own and have never read it.
I recently started picking up Make magazine as well.
I read a tech book every month.
Git just never gets priority.
3>70 O'Reilly books
3>Never read K&R
I like O'Reilly.
No Starch have recently started to really prove themselves as well.
Although I believe they were bought out (or at least collaborate strongly with) O'Reilly now anyway.
A hard-copy of K&R is the difference between the men who mean SRS BUSINESS and the boys.
Dawid: Text adventure games in C are fun.
And easy.
Dawid: The only C book I've ever read is K&R.
I think from that point you should read books that talk about programmign rather than teach a single language.
Although the No Starch Debuggers, Debugging etc. book is excellent.
And that knowing how ot use GDB is essential.
I found "Expert C Programming" by Peter van Linden interesting.
But it's not actually a good book.
It's mainly anecdotes and interesting stories more than helpful knowledge.
Dawid: If you're interested in text adventures you shoudl watch Get Lamp.
Hitchhiker's Guid is and probably always will be my favourite.
I also liked Gateway 1 & 2 very much.
Spellcasting 101/201/301 also acceptable if you like slightly bawdy humour.
Oh, excellent.
I never liked the Zork games.
Which is, to some degree, blasphemy.
Zork and Cave Adventure were both such early examples.
So ridiculously complex.
You literally HAVE to draw insane maps.
You'll end up like the dude in A Beautiful Mind.
With paper blu-tacked up on your walls and bits of string linking ideas from place to place.
I know exactly what you mean.
But, then, I'd rather a game bee too linear and easy than impossibly hard.
I like books. I don't mind games that are glorified books.
I don't really need the puzzle-solving aspect any more.
I get that from actually useful activities.
Like programming, yes.
You don't get a useful program at the end of a text adventure.
I hope so.
I now prefer to solve puzzle about solving puzzles.
Like the crossword assistant I wrote a while back.
Broken Sword 1&2 are excellent games.
As are the Monkey Island trilogy.
If you like those
Try Gabriel Knight.
Spierek: I'll write a program that writes programs that solve my puzzles for me.
I didn't like 3.
Never finished it.
Can't believe I got bored enough to take part in it.
It's a very long thread.
Originally about children on Facebook.
Which then became about pedophilia laws.
And then marriage terminology.
You always know a conversation has sunk to its lowest level when people want to argue about semantics.

God damn if they aren't just plain alright.
Second paragraph of that article.
Basically: Fedora could have made a key really easily but it would have given them a priveleged position that could be anti-competative and
3>Adopting a distribution-specific key and encouraging hardware companies to adopt it would have been hostile to other distributions. We want to compete on merit, not because we have better links to OEMs
That would be

and yes, it is monopoly abuse.
But Apple are now enough of a competitor that Microsoft will be able ot get away with it.
Effectively, the millions Microsoft invested in Apple are paying off.

I liked the new Tron.
It didn't totally fuck up all the stuff I liked about the original.

Calm: Learn to use gdb.
3>Windows
You're on your own.
But yes, it's usable within Cygwin.
http://ompldr.org/vZTh4aw
Suddenly segfaults become trivially easy to diagnose and fix.
Yes.
And it allows you to inspect the stack and local variables at the time of the crash.
It's essential learning.
Any good compiler should support gdb debugging symbols.
Clang and GCC both work on Windows, right?
No idea, I'm afraid.
I did qualify and say "any GOOD compiler".
Simpel enough then, Calm.
Just compile with the -g flag.
Or specifically ask for gdb symbols with -ggdb
You can see how I've run it there.
It's exactly the same in Cygwin.
I probably should have used the long words.
gdb allows you to just use shortened versions of commands.
i lo = information local
r = run
l = list
p = print
etc.
No Starch do a great book.
I might have a PDF.

Well, that's one extremely good reason. Yes.
To be honest, no networked program should be run as root if possible.
Unless it's been extremely heavily security tested.
I believe DCC also requires two users to trade IP addresses.
Which knocks away a layer of safety for users.

I basically told a guy on /g/ to fight corruption in government rather than various stealth taxes in the name of intellectual property.
Manhose: Yes, I did.
chown: I was in London on Monday, actually.
You're always welcome to come to Norwich.
I'm sure I've offered to show anybody who visits all the best pubs and buy them a beer before.
Yes, we definitely do.
In fact, adultwork has some of its best "escorts" in Norwich.
naosia: Why?
Oh yeah, fair point.
Still, I used to get underage peopel drunk all the time.
How do you think girls work?
I met one of my best buds (now) a couple of days after his 16th birthday at an induction day at a supermarket when I was, like, 19.
And I took him down the pub and got him drunk at lunchtime.
naosia: Yeah, just go to a shitty one that's glad of the business.
In fact, it's legal for children of any age to drink in a pub. Theyr'e just not allowed at the bar.

Weed is for losers.
Why is weed for losers?
Most downers are for losers.
Ket is the worst.
It's just the mindset that goes with being psychologically attracted to the downer effect.
Weed has a little bit of everything mixed in; it's a VERY mild hallucinogenic and has a little bit of the upper buzz.
So it doesn't fit nicely into that category.
But it fits in enough.
Mixed in with the culture that attracts people...
Yes, everybody is of course a special and individual snowflake.
I think doing something that lumps you in with a well-established crowd and then expecting people to treat you as an individual is a bit vain and unrealistic, though.
I think you're misrepresenting a mild effect of a downer with a major effect of an upper, though, which is misrepresenting.
I think weed is fine enough very sporadically.
But I think it's an insidiously "addictive" drug.
I quote "addictive" like that because I think the addictiveness is mainly a social and psychological effect.
And I think people who do it regularly really do become useless fucking losers.
Whichever way around the cause and effect are.
Although I think each may be mutually causative of the other.
Everybody knows that crowd.
Weed: It's for losers.
And people who just want to play losers at the weekend.
Because they think weed is cool
because rappers do it.
Actually, I think it was recently brought back up to class B.
class A = "Hard stuff"
class C = "Leastcontrolled"
Manhose: None of the fun ones.
Rohypnol.
Ket.
Valium.
All the downers.
Amazingly, ritalin is class B.
With speed and the minor meths.
Manhose: I could do with one for the GF.
naosia: ?
naosia: Which is fine.
It's still, by and large, use by and for losers.
The loser:normal guy ratio of peopel I know who smoke is massively skewed towards the losers.
Yup.
I've been around a long time. I've met a lot of people.
I trust my own experience.
chown: Sure.
naosia: Great but expensive.
What do you want to know? It just makes you feel like you're having a great time and not want to go home.
Manhose: Not really. Bluesing the next morning is extremely common.
Manhose: yeah, right after you HOUR OF AWESOME you immediately need some more or you crash right out.
naosia: Nope. tried a few of the amphets, though.
I had a girlfriend who liked poppers.
I certainly did.
I also did them when I was in highschool.
Silly kids stuff because one of my friends was always in this mad headshop buying incense and being a fucking hippy.
So he'd always have poppers.

I don't like anything I can think is a good idea when I'm drunk that can kill me.

I don't even really like LSD.
It's easily been 10 years since I did that.

But I know there's one set between Dune and Dune Messiah.

Fair enough.

Literally just read the Dune page on wikipedia.
And all the plot entries.

Older women are awful.

Who are probably older than naosia's parents...
In fact... I must be somewhere around naosia's parents' age...
Really? Your parents are mid-40s?
I guess that's fairly standard.
My girlfriend's dad is 38 (I think).
He's certainly not quite 40.

I like that she has young parents.
Means they're not fucking boring to be around.
She's also one of the few girls I've ever bee nwith that don't have massive daddy issues.

I said earlier that I was going to eat a pork pie and drink a beer to assert my masculinity.
I ate 2 scotch eggs, 2 pork pies and drank 6 pints.
They are normally quite firmly linked.
In fact, some would say that your sexuality not being linked to your gender flies in the face of evolutionary imperative.
Scothc egg is the best thing ever.
I found a place that does one with chilli peppers in it.

All the hardcore butch lesbians I know are starting to have relationships with men.
One of them is even in a relationship with the creepiest pedophile I have ever seen.
naosia: I'm not getting what you're on about at all. I re-read and everything.
I swear
This guy is literally all over this lesbian girl because she looks and dresses like a young boy.
And he's fuckign weird.
You know people who you literally can't have a conversation with because they're so fuckign awkward?
Nobody's that awkward unless they have something to hide.
naosia: I doubt you're as weird as this guy.
Oh, and he's also in his late 30s.
If you get to late 30s and you still can't cope with social situations you're a fuckign weirdo.
I Googled "Raborn."

Good one.
The best IDE is whatever you make for yourself from pieces.
Depends.
Depends what "error checking" you want.
Not using Eclipse.
... or, I guess, any plugin that instantly crashes or exits Eclipse.
Vim snaps you to build errors by default.
Highlights unmatched braces
etc.
Godo for you.
But you'll have to be more specific.
Everything available there is available with a piecemeal setup.
You mean you want runtime errors or compile time errors handled?
:make
Up pops errors.
Vim snaps you to the line.
No idea. That would bug the hell out of me and I've not looked into it.
If the answer to your problem is "nest lots of ifs or whiles" then you're not thinking things through.

How are your desoldering skills?
I'd just do the whole lot and save myself the hassle later.
Not much more work while you've got it open.
Do you have a low-wattage iron and one of those desoldering suckers?
And a bit of wick
All 3 are essential if you want to do a reasonable job of it.
Yeah, I desolder everything I get the chance to.
Godo practise.
I threw away an old toaster the other day and it had discrete resistors.
so they're worth less than a penny apiece. I still desoldered every last one ofthem.
brundlefly: I don't have anything in particular in mind. A generic signal amplifier for a speaker system will suffice.
Which should be fine enough for whatever.
Obviously not taking pains to bother too much with extremely low range stuff like you need ot for a bass amp.
Fairly certain that's more of a speaker problem anyway.
Just reading bakc on the buffer real quick.
brundlefly: Low amperage?
What transistors did you use?
And what size caps?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I'm having to get all of material from all over the place.
Haven't done much signal processing before.
agaric: 15W iron, desoldering wire, desoldering pump.
10W iron if you can find one.
Assume it's lead solder.
Most standard irons are 30W+ and can easily damage other components
If you have any little crocodile clips to use as heatsinks then definitely do that.
Literally just clip them on to the connections of other components.
Stops the other components getting hot and getting damaged.
Adjustable is always very nice.
With a "pencil" tip.
Small, obviously.
If you buy a set then the smallest one will be what you want.
Could even go smaller.

Even the cheap chinese ones work well enough.
Hell, the worst that could happen is it's slightly under-wattage.
And that's fine, because it's for delicate work anyway.

Assume every project won't work

Hey, guys.
Anybody inetersted in the Liberated Pixel Cup?
The coding section has started.
I've been talking to the organiser. He's very enthusiastic.
Have you looked at the resources that are up from the art part of the competition?
And do you have any game ideas?
chown: #liberatedpixelcup on Freenode.
So
If collaboration was on the cards you would want to use python or Go?
Or we could, of course, happily not collaborate at all.
Probably Python, then.
I'm still trying to find the correct game idea, though.
And I'm browsing through the art to help.
Do you have any ideas?
I normally elan towards an RPG for this kind of thing.
And the art seems condusive to that.
Yes.
ABS?
Active Battle System?
That's a Final Fantasy thing.
You mean like an action RPG?
Basically a bar that counts up until you can take your turn.
FF did it in 1995 or whatever it was with FF 6.
1994.
OK.
I don't know. I think action is more difficult than turn-based.
A village/town building game might be doable.
DF mixed with tower defense.
Nope.
Looking into it.
Ah, OK.
Have you ever played Disgaea?
Nah
It's simple enough.
But anyway.
Need an idea.
I guess all the best games start small.
We could just rip off something like HeroQuest.
Yes.
I thought it was O.K..
Never played a huge amount of it, though.

I was strongly considering buying the "Beautiful" book series recently.
Beautiful Code / Beautiful Design / Beautiful Security etc.
They're basically books full of anecdotes and stories from programming/tech "celebrities" with code snippets.

I read Beautiful Code a while back in PDF form. It was really excellent.

I bet Beautiful Security is really interesting.

The Cathedral and The Bazaar, The Future of Ideas, Hacking: The Art Of Exploitation, Land Of Lisp, Reversing: Secrets Of Reverse Engineering, SICP (obviously)
The Art of Debugging
"The Dragon Book" aka Compilers Principles, Techniques and Tools
O'Reilly's "Flex And Bison"
SICP is genuinely one of the best programming books of all time.
The first edition of the dragon book does.
The 2006 edition doesn't.
SICp teaches Scheme specifically.
Learning to program in Scheme is only one chapter, really.
About chapter 3.
teaches programming magic.
Scheme has so little syntax that it's learnt incredibly quickly.
Once that's out of the way you can be a wizard.
And then you can spend the next 20 years learning all of Common Lisp's features.
If you get stuck on the "learning to program" part of SICP you can always read Land Of Lisp.
which covers Common Lisp extensively.
And then go back to the magic.
Hah
I think Scheme is ridiculously easy to learn anyway.
So yes.
The Scheme way is "the programmer doesn't have to worry about fuckign anything to do with syntax"
The Common Lisp way is "mastering the syntax lets you do more magic faster" at the expense of being simple.
Fair enough. If that's your way then that's why Scheme exists.
Learn You A Haskell For Great Good is also excellent.
If a little stuffy.
Despite major attempts not to be.
It is quite dry.
Even Land Of Lisp recommends trying Haskell.

To be honest, the worst part was allowing myself to be seduced by the STL.
But the OO was what I really hated.

I liek all the new stuff from C11.
That'll do for me.
notwa: wat wat?
Sorry, I just realised I put C11 rather than C++11.
Initializer lists are something I use a huge amount.
That C++11 borrows from C.

What's wrong with security certifications?
Well that really fucking depends.
What if you're not going for a coding job?
Security certs are normally about best practises with networks and users.
Hell, if you're doign any coding work where security could potentially be a problem your employer should be using higher-level tools that eliminate vulnerabilities.

I can't believe the number of /g/ people who support the American Libertarian Party.
Worst kind of monsters.
What? Why?
Your political views are extremely integral to who any thinking person is.
I don't agree with supporting any one party, particularly...
Especially any of the main ones.
That I can get behind to some degree...
Although there are some political parties one supports because of one's views.
Which is fine.
But I think the "big 3" in America and the "big 3" in the U.K. are a waste of time supporting because they're so horrendously similar.
My experience of Americans is that they don't know shit about politics or economics.
Just like everyone else.
Yeah, American news genuinely seems insane.
I'm glad we have the BBC. It seems to keep out news guys in line to some degree.
Bahahaha
To be honest, I'm pretty much a Marxist.
I'd like to move to America just so that I can annoy Americans.
I'm going to a careers fair next week because I'm considering taking an offshore engineering job.
Because the pay is insane.
How does he handle it?
I mean... if your'e a Marxist you have to be a bit politically active...
But you can't really vote for the Lib Dems and then go "close enough."
Hell, I find myself supporting the Green Party purely because they're the only left-wing party that actually runs at local level.
inb4 Labour are left-wing
BullSHIT.
Labour are centrist at best.
Really? That's awesome.
I'd love to work for a group that I really, honestly support.
Really? doing what?
I'm not sure if I could live with myself working for some huge energy company, for example, knowing all the shit they pull politically.
What was your "workfare" experience like in a nutshell?

But probably not.
Unless there was a really good reason.
I don't particularly care about those people.
Because, apparently, they don't care about me.
Just my money.
I love that redlizard is my FOSSfriend
Normally when I say this stuff I just have auREAX moaning at me the whole time.
BFF PAL 4 LYF <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
auREAX has a channel for Visual Novel devs that don't really get the whole FOSS thing.
Oh, OK. You're the highest level mod I see there.
Most of the guys there, I think, are more interested in telling stories than the software used to do so.
Can't remember the name of the Python platform for VNs...
That's the one.
So yeah... they're not really developing much in the way of software, but creating a story.
And, unless they go to quite extreme lengths, they're also distributing source.
As Stallman said to me in a recent email, though, software without a license is completely restricted.
Oh, really? That's shitcocks.
One thing I am really interested in with regards to the FSF is protection for anonymous coders.
Although I'm not sure how it would/could be handled.
Developing crypto, for example, can get you in trouble with authorities in totalitarian and extremely oppressive countries liek China and the U.S.A..
But if you want the software to be free you have to apply your personal copyright.
Maybe the EFF would consider acting as a proxy for anonymous programmers.

3>NC
3>GPL
You can sell GPL software if you can find a market.
Irrelevant.
Nobody's going to buy your VN either.
Yup.
So NC is irrelevant by your own logic.
Are you saying that you're avoiding the GPL because you want my money?
Then it's not the same.
You're certainly getting very upset over such a small matter.
You jumped to namecalling.
That's normally a bad sign.
But you WOULD say that.
Bahaha
So srs
Was there any relevance to the original?
You wanted my comments on a license you couldn't change if you wanted to?
And, specifically, over the NC part, which we've both said doesn't really matter.
You please me every day by being such a cheeky little cherub.
So pugnacious.
You know neither of those are derogatory, right?
How so?
HAH
If you're going to bother people at least let it be in an attempt to do some good.
Or people who collect for cancer support.
Or people who ask you to sign petitions to help people who have been victims of police brutality.
Or whatever.
Because mob mentality isn't always right.
If nobody ever nudges others to think about morality in more depth then we end up with 7 billion islands of individual morality.
And, to be honest, I don't trust corporations, who control all of our media, to help people make that decision without saying my piece as well.
I don't think it's the GPL people who ALWAYS bother you first, auREAX.
I have an incling you may start some of these conversations.
So... you're complaining about people asking for what they want?
No way.
People askign for what they want is what drives markets.
If anything, I count that as a FOSS win.
Nope.
People want it licensed more permissively. What do you want, censorship?
Then what?
Your complaint seems to be "people shouldn't ask for/talk about things that I don't agree with"
And people have their reasons for asking.

I bought it for my GF.

It even covers microcontrollers to a small degree.
I bought her the book and then viciously beat her.
To even it out.
Just like I learnt from the Knights Of The Old Republic and Fable games.
Actually, I never took a microcontroller module.
I didn't even touch them formally until I had a job working with them.

That's more of a problem with a dream.

As a general rule of thumb, if somebody asks me a question and I don't knwo the answer I read a book on it.
agaric: What's it called?
I'm under the impression almost all games use UDP.
Ahhhh, OK.
I think I saw a blog post by one of the Runescape coders abotu the problems he faced making it, actually.
Still, they did the right thing.
Having massive back-compatibility with old versions meant people could pla ythat shit in schools etc.
Which I believe was 90% of their playerbase.
I have a funny feeling you're about to ask how to handle all that threading in a cross-platform way...
If not, I'd like to know what your plans are in regards to that.
Or does the server not have to be cross-platform?
Oh, OK. That saves a headache.
Obviously C11 brings in support for multi-threading.
GCC does to a small extent.
It's something to look forwards to.
Not sure about the threading libs.
No idea, I'm afraid.
But if you're doing ANY multi-threading in C I suggest you look into it.
Rather than rely on pthreads.
But I guess if you're targeting *NIX exclusively it's not a big deal and you might just want to use what you know.
slacky: How does the RuneScape client handle such problems?
If you're scared about innovating there's no shame in sticking to the tried-and-true.
Yes.
brb 2 secs
What's wrong with that?
Ah, I see. You want to do *better*.
Oh, OK, OBVIOUSLY you don't have code for the server?
Why did I not realsie this earlier?
For some reason I just assumed you had the pair.
slacky: I'm not following.
Are you basically saying you want a staggered version of the game tick?
No, wait, I get you. I read that totally wrong.
Ok
So
Soudns liek a nightmare.
It makes threading a problem, unless your'e going to update your data in ticks.
Read from your data dynamically.
Write to yoru data in ticks.
Otherwise you'll have to handle race conditions and have data that is smart enough to know its own state.
Yes, you could use an event queue.
That *IS* good.
It solves a big chunk of your problems right out.
Yay
Problems I can help with that aren't networking
WHATAMILOOKINGAT.COM
hrm?
Sorry for what?
inb4 I find out something TERRIBLE has happened
agaric: Have you ever written in Smalltalk.
Your diagram looks like the Smalltalk-type diagrams.
If you think like that maybe it would be good for you.
The idea that programs are made of parts that send messages to each other and out through the network or other methods.
I've been reading a really good book on cryptography recently.
I should probably study the network side of things more.
Get this as a cool device;
The problem with crypto is that your key always needs to be stored somewhere.
So
They need to be generated from a seed that is as random as possible.
Not really the problem, though.
The cool thing with, say, RSA keys is that they can be hashed in such a way that they require a password.
So, I was thinking of creating a USb device for myself that hold my keys and is itself encrypted and requires a password.
And I put a keypad right on the device.
Just as a proof-of-concept.
Wouldn't it just?
I didn't give you +v, so I wouldn't know.
I think agaric gave you it.
I'm also fairly certain only agaric can give you permanent +v.
I don't see why you wouldn't have it.
Jally
yeah.
it's the program's job to re-assemble correctly.
If the order the packets are received in matters you'll need to put your own counter in to your frames.
Amazingly, TCP uses 4 bytes, I believe.
Your own implementation could very easily make more efficient use of space by using a byte.
But it's extra work.
And do you really need to make use of those 3 extra bytes?
Large UDP packets are, of course, prone to being corrupted.
You could use your event queue to help you...
Give each client a pointer to a place on your event stack for its last update.
It's always simpler to use TCP.
You know to keep your networking stuff separate. You can always overhaul it for efficiency's sake later.
Hey, redlizard.
slacky is making an MMO server.
How are your networkign skills?
Good for you! Mine are rusty and were never great in the first place.
You've never seen it, slacky?
It's the FFUUTTUURRREEE
au^3 is just upset because he never got his chocolate-flavoured toilet seat as promised.
noyes
I don't think it'd be that much harder.
Efficiency.
He wants 4k clients per server and multiple servers.
^
That is why I said TCP.
Hah.
redlizard: The client he's studying uses TCP.
For me that was good enough reason.
Copy what you have if you're not sure.
And, again, the rule-of-thumb that you use TCP unless you have a godo reason not to.
Anybody know a good utility for making gifs more efficient?
Like pngcrush
But for gifs?
Did anybody see the mad shit that's happening in the U.K. with encryption?
5 year prison sentence if you have anything thta looks like it might be encrypted data and don't produce a key on demand.
The example given was for files that are telescope or radio noise.
Collected for, for example, entropy.
If the U.K. government thinks it's encrypted data it's a prison snetence.
redlizard: I think the idea is that if the client can handle continuing without a resend it's all good.
If slacky can, for example, write logic to handle the problem to a reasonable tolerance.
or am I just seeing that because I'm not payign full attention?
redlizard: Scaling? Could save a reasonable amount of bandwidth.
brb my fire alarm is going nuts for no real reason
You don't need to persuade me. I say use TCP.
UDp is potentially a lot of work for not much gain.
DEAD
Latency
Hah
Then why were we even talking about UDP?
Hah.
The old "Make one, throw that away, make a better one" cycle.
slacky: You don't use any interpreted languages?
Good man.
3>Two threads reach bump limit about Vim

au^3: I hate it because I've used it.

I think the STL is bad enough.
Boost
Eugh
slacky: That makes us hipsters.
I got 10K LOC deep into a project and just went "It's been 10 years. Lets leave it for 10 more."
I honestly think my last C++ project was 2001 or 2002.
redlizard: And au^3
i like lots of languages for lots of different things.
I don't like C++.
Except for the part of it that is beautiful C.
au^3: I'm reading up on references.
I just can't see why I'd use them.
Eh. The design part is what takes the longest.
Type out a couple of extra lines while you think about your implementation.
slacky: Unlimited syntactical depth.
slacky: No, it's not just boost. I thought I was the only one who noticed it.
Yup.
Not terrible in itself or, indeed, a reason not to use it though.
To each their own and all that.
ShameOnATrip: I might do. Dpeends how generous I'm feeling.
And if I can remember.
au^3: I like Python.
I just have trouble finding a use for it.
Perl handles my quick hacks and C handles my proper projects.
I might use it for some small interesting program some time.
I'm fine with Python's syntax.
I also quite like Haskell's syntax but get upset with its poor REPL.
I prefer to write pure functional code in Haskell but Lisp is easier to work with through its great REPL.
redlizard: So what do you use for quick work?
redlizard: You don't like Perl?
redlizard: using strict;
Fair enough.
Great for fast hacks, though.
Nope.
 /data/init
It's in there doemwhere
ShameOnATrip: Run

I don't know shit about anime. I'll watch a movie if it looks good, though.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
I like the guy that eats stuff.
I'm vaguely aware that it's all based on Japanese folklore.
I know they associate water with spirits.
The anime that I've seen has tended to not shy away from actually having interesting story.
I don't think many people enjoy movies with a real plot.
Trying to get my friends to watch the Godfather movies was just upsetting.
Oh.
I watched all of Neon Genesis Evangelion.
Even though it was weird.
I just grabbed the Studio Ghibli torrent.
I might watch all of those.
I liked 2 of their movies already.

Maybe you guys should stop crying about not being able to write C and learn some Lisp?
The two most beautiful languages I know, hands down.
Actually, I think Python is the most strictly defined language as far as syntax goes.
I see C and Lisp at opposite ends of the abstraction spectrum.
And Perl and Python at opposite neds of the syntax rigidity spectrum.
agaric: Many languages have syntax requirements built into the spec.
Python does, for example.
In fact, as far as I know all do.
... except Perl.
Which doesn't even have a standard.
The interpreter is the standard.
Same.
The same way you can love a gun for being an efficient killing machine but also hate guns for what they are used for.
It just doesn't feel safe in the hands of anybody who's not you.
And even then you constantly have to handle it carefully.

Because everybody who uses Lisp invariably improves it for their own use.

That will make some people very upset.

Nice one, redlizard.
And it all turned out
Better than expected.
I was really expecting working on that library to be a thankless task.
It's nice when everything falls into place like that.
ToutBeefer: I like that book.
Unfortunately lots of people care aboutthe torrent a lot more now that it actually exists
And we're getting all these great suggestions that we don't really knowwhat to do with
Except start talking about v2 of the torrent.
Longlius: I own a copy of that book.
I don't think it's out of date at all.
The only thing that really requires you to act differently is with the buffer overruns early on
Modern Linux has memory area protection
But the book comes with a CD of an old distro that you can use for the early exploits.
Welcoem to old distros. ;_;
Longlius: Upsetting
But still. It's only those early buffer overruns.
I can't think of anything else in the whole book that doesn't work on modern systems.
Oh
A bit on metasploit is out of date.
But then
Read a book on Metasploit, you know?
It's the kind of thing that needs it own book anyway.
Fairly certain it does.
My girlfriend's friend is staying in my bed tonight otherwise I'd go and get it and have a look.
I'm not sure, but how will the delta algo hold up to that kind of size?
I imagine badly.
And yes, what auREAX_ said.
It's for text, really, not binary data.
Although
I guess git is smart enough that it woulddrop the deltas altogether for binaries.
And just mark files for moving and replacement well.
Which it handles excellenty.
It is something that is difficult to forsee all of the complications of until you try it.
Ah, yes, good point.
I think that the main problem would be that it is a lot of work for very little gain and getting people to adopt it could be a problem.
I say we just merge the version in my ~/into wherever naosia was keeping the old lib
And then modify the one in my ~/
And don't move things. Just add things.
And then we can release updated torrents that fit over the old one.
Every, say, 6 months or yearly.
redlizard: I'd be interested on working on such a solution.
But we'd need proper design docs before we start.
Man, I wish SUPER ENTERPRISE Manhose were here.
He's have diagrams and shit all made up before we even finished discussing protocols.
Well, collaboration would be easy to handle for maybe just two of us.
But UML would be great if other people want to contribute.
And I'm so lazy. I want other people to make all of it for me, ideally.
... and I fucking HATE making all that enterprise bunk.
Manhose lives and breathes it.
The idea has potential. Count me as interested at the very least.
I'll have a ponder about it myself.
If we make the versioning one way
We don't need to have two copies of everything.
Otherwise you need to have lots of data to allow stepping back
For revisions.
But you can drop a lot of data if your changes are applied incrementally in one direction.
Like patches.
So effectively... We could work with incremental patch files?
I mean... that's classic. We don't even need to write that.
OK
So
Take the torrent protocol and drop file arrangement completely.
We just add more files to a torrent formatted to work with out incremental system.
And then our incremental patch files handle arangement.
Yeah.
And then the incremental patch system arranges it.
That fixes our sorting problem.
The torrent would need to have some data saying which version it's at.
And then our system can take over from there.
Uh...
Yes.
Wait.
Yes
But it means that peers using old versions will never 100%
Not really.
Update.
But they obviously won't be able to get new files from people using an old torrent or old files from people using a new torrent from which the file has been removed.
But I don't see that as a problem.
Files get removed for a reason.
People using old torrents 99%ing because we removed a dupe or something is fine.
I don't think it is a good idea.
The idea is that the updates are supposed to be indisputably good.,
Hah. I just realised that's awful.
But I mean... People can always use an old torrent.
The .torrent file is the revision.
Ahhh
Incremental patch files should be bundled with incremental .torrent files, too.
As pairs.
Easy revision 101
I don't see why not.
Sure.
But then we can just add to the protocol some method of syncing with a remote.
<You are using an old version of this torrent. Sync up to http://mysite.com:9938/Gentoomen-Library>
Erm...
I don't see why people couldn't continue to run the old torrents for a while.
Ah
So...
Make the files all hashmaps in, say, a .data directory and then the file heirachy is actually symlinks?
redlizard: How about
The incremental update doesn't flush old files
Until you call for a cleanup.
So people can seed old versions happily if they want.
Wait
Downloading conflicts.
Trying to run multiple torrents downloading to the same dir is a recipe for disaster.
It's fine if you're seeding.
We'll just need some safeguards.
To make sure people aren't running multiple versions of the torrent ever.
redlizard: Really? I'm not so sure.
Ah
Ah
Ah
Make the torrents incremental updates?
Newer torrents only contain the patch and new files?
So we have our base .torrent now
And the nnext one just downloads a few extra files into .data
And a script for changing arrangement.
OK
Well
This is definitely doable.
And we keep all historic files?
Hrm.
Won't removing historic files break the old .torrents?
Or are you saying complete updated torrents rather than torrents containing incremental updates?
Well
There are two ways of handling new .torrent files.
A complete update that adds new files and contains the old listing
And incremental updates that just add a few new files.
And run concurrently with the original.
OK.
But a magictorrent will contain a .torrent, right?
And then some logic for incremental updates.
So it's a .torrent and update logic bundle.
Ah, OK.
So the client is smart and will handle the update logic for us.
Yeah, that's totally doable.
I was thinking the easiest route initially, which was just to bundle an update script or soemthing.
Maintaining control over how the .torrent client is handled is good...
But will be harmful for adoption.
Ah, good point.
Our .torrent will still be backwards-compatible because our files will actually be in their heirachy properly.
The magictorrent client handles the .data directory.
Oh fuck.
Yeah
It's easy to forget that the torrent chunks overlap files.
I think it probably will be a problem.
You'll end up with partial files of deleted files, I think.
Or maybe not.
Or maybe
Yeah
Updating when you're not at 100%
Could be a problem with the chunks.
Although the magictorrent system could handle that...
Why would the mt be any different?
We're still relying upon what the .torrent can do forthat prt.
Unless we hndle every file as a separate torrent
Which is a flat-out "no"
OK
We have a fairly good rough idea of how to handle the core of this.
Yeah.
Partial chunks have to be re-grabbed.
We could reduce that by using small chunk sizes in the torrents.
That solves our problem for us to a major degree if it does.
That's not what I'm worried about, though.
I'm more worried that updating from incomplete torrents will mean that files are expected where they don't exist.
Hang on
We're overlooking something.
Let me stop and think for a second
Why are we keeping old files in .data, exactly?
If your torrents aren't going to be backwards-compatible between versions?
our*
The old .torrents will have to have dotfiles with complete symlink structures in them.
That the .torrent files point to.
The .torrent file requires that you have all the files it expects in allthe places it expects to seed.
We're moving files and removing files between updates.
OK
Although we could forgoe that.
Using a simple symlink structure.
KISS
Yeah.
Add clever stuff later.
OK, that's cleared my mind on that matter.
One main thing, though.
If we do make this client we should publish our format.
And we'd haveto do a write-up of whatever method we use.
I will admit this, though;
Windows might pose a problem for our simple version.
I'm not sure about working with their filesystem and symlinks and dotfiles etc.
They have symlinks
Really? That's insane.
I say we go the symlink route initially and then handle it in the client.
v2 = Smart client virtual filename resolution.
OK
I think that's all the basics covered.
?
Oh man TWO
Yeah...
That needs some thought.
Again, I'd lean towards RSS initially and add cleverness later unless somebody hasa really good idea.
OK, authenticity is easy.
Just add key signing.
Distribute the public key with the magictorrent.
Sign new releases with a private key.
Job done.
Again, though, not a feature necessary out of the box.
The alpha version can do without initially.
Yeah.
OK
Other than "lets use RSS until somebody has a better idea"
No.
Yeah
This could eat right into my flamewar time.
If you guys have any thoughts on such a project please feel free to jump in.
I have no solution for the update announcing.
chown: It's not encrypted.
You use separate keys for encrypting and signing.
chown: The public and private keys can BOTH be used to make keys that "unlock" each other.
I prefer Cryptography Engineering.
Also Schneier.
Less theoretical. More practical.
Even Applied Cryptography, attempting to be more practical, was too academic for me.
I like making shit.
Longlius: So I hear. <3
OK, I say we let the project cool and sink in for a day or two.
Gather ideas from more people. It's very easy for the two of us to miss something.
chown: Yes.
But remember that encrypting and signing are two different things.
Using two different keys.
First you must make apple pie.

Not that much different.
There is no sound in dreams.
It means you added the dialogue afterwards.
Based upon your interpreted meaning of the dream.
So the answer is
You already know what it means.
I read a whole bunch of dream studies years back when I was suffering from sleep paralysis.
Apparently it's a reasonably well-known fact that you add the sound later yourself.
[VDG]chown: EEG
planimal: At the end.
Yes.
Let me see if I can find a source.
Although dreams are still mainly the most mysterious things ever, so I wouldn't be totally surprised if the scientific world has completely changed its mind.
Lucid dreams are different.
The reason I looked it up was because, with sleep paralysis, I was still able to see and hear when dreamstate began.
They also refer to such experiences as "night hags"
Prier: Yes, it is.
I used to have fucking terrible ones all the time.
Dreams of fire and scary shadow people moving about and the like.

planimal: I haven't looked into it for years as they sort of went away on their own. I'll see what I can do.
Prier: yes, the theory is that that sense of dread, combined with your comin dream state, has a tendency to find personification.

BP|work: Actually... it's not a terrible idea.
A better idea would be to give each person a private/public key pair.
And the person uploads their public key to sites they need to login to.
But whatever.
Allow people to store their private key in the form of a piece of hardware.
That allows authentication to be handled but not for the whole key to be read once it's been written.
i.e. implement the ability to work with, say, RSA in hardware.
teh ability to write a key as many times as you want.
And implement in hardware an inability to recover the key.
Sure.
But hardware can eliminate the standard "you're only as secure as the place where you keep your key" problem.
Sure.
And as much as I said "eliminate"
There is no perfect solution.
Regardless of the how
Public/private keys are superior.
Especially when the keys are protected with a password.
Safely using the same password with all web sites would be amazing.
Indeed.
I don't know how Python does it.
It's a Perl one-liner, though.

Hey. agaric
Read this
http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521008042/ref=ox_ya_os_product
... and with that, I'm going back to bed.
Almost certainly.
agaric: If you pick up any "beginning formal logic" book you'll steam through most of it.
You know most of it without realising that you know it already.
The only thing you really need to learn is how to express yourself in this formal language.
Well...
Logic is logic.

So long as your'e talking to somebody who knows what your upside-down "T" means and you can translate the nouns you're all good.
^^
If you can read Python you can read a Chinese person's program.
You just might need some minor translation of the comments.
I've always felt the other way around.
Natural language describes important ideas clumsily and with ambiguities.
You may as well write all of your maths in words.
Being undefined means that it sucks for talking about ideas formally.
At some point you always have to stop and talk about your syntax.
Formal logic provides a language to avoid that.
You can express anything exactly if your syntax is well-enough defined.
redlizard: Name?
agaric: You can, of cours,e use poorly-defined natural language to define something else, but your definition is open to interpretation and can be misinterpreted.
Natural language is like unstandardised compiler additions.
agaric: If you need mroe formal logic you just add more.
But anything you can describe in natural language can be said in formal logic.
And without the sloppy definitions gettign i nthe way.
Anyway, I've g2g.
Back in a bit.
I will agree ot this, though; soemtimes it's easier to just say it.
Right tool for the job and all that.

C-x 1
C-x 2
You should now have a vertical split.
Do you know how to change buffers?
"C-x o" changes between windows.
"C-x b" lets you change buffers.
OK, cool.
So you have everything you need?
Those window commands are
C-x 1 = Just show this window
C-x 2 = Split horizontally
C-x 3 = Split vertically
C-x 0 = Kill this window
Simples.

Emacs is great for exactly that kind of task.

Petit_Dejeuner: truth be told, I've never read either.
But I've read learnign and Programming Perl.
And a few other O'Reilly books.
And I know people who have read and enjoyed it in real life.
Still. I think the Learning X series teach you enough to feel like a goddamn wizard from not being able to program at all.
Learnign Perl taught you everything you needed to know.
And yes, I think the layout was similar.
Ad Programming Perl covered a lot of CPAN that was awesome but not essential to your understanding of the language.
Really?
O'Reilly's Learning X books ahev always been aimed at non-programmers.
Like in many things, I've found it easier to find things I don't like than something solid to recommend.
Learn X The Hard Way
I do not like.
But I at least know that with O'Reilly they're not getting a solid book.
Maybe not the best, but I know it's safe to recommend.
Programmign is for everyone smart enough to realise how important it is.
it's not even about that.
Programming is, first and foremost, about making your computer work correctly.
Advanced concepts are for people who want to go further.

I'm terrible with stupid people.
Petit_Dejeuner: Not much difference in the corporate world.
I've come to accept that I lack empathy. This is fine.
Depends what you mean by "small."
I know of a lot of factories locally that have 100-200 people that need sysadmins for their day-to-day office stuff.
I also know a couple of people who work at web design startups that have sysadmins.
Handling their servers.
So I guess it really dpeends what the company does.
Yup.
I read a chapter of Beautiful Code based around Ruby. It looks O.K..
But it didn't look any prettier than Python and it benchmarked (even just in that article) much worse than Perl.
So why should I care?
I've also worked with Ruby briefly with metasploit.
Soudns like I'd have to get pretty deep to see those things, though.
Maybe one day i'll work on somebody else's Ruby project and be amazed.
But it's suffering from being a tool for jobs that I already have good tools for.

Nope.
ant[4-6] are not initialized.
p *ants
Oh, having said that...
No, what I said is correct.
initialize_ant shoudl return an ant* and take an id as an argument.
I see what you're doing wrong.
initialize_ant is taking a pointer
And then changign that pointer in its stsck frame
And returning nothing.
Do you see?
in initialize_ant a is a local variable set when the frame is created.
And you're changing it locally.

Every surface-to-surface copy/blit is validity checked, for example.
It is. In ways that don't really matter, though.
You shouldn't vbe drawing off-surface regardless. Relying upon the lib to handle that for you is bad.
It does have some extra clunky stuff for using animations.
In fucking
XML.
EUGH
mf: If you want a segfault.
And that only works because SDL uses powers of 2 for surface sizes.
You could always take 2 seconds to write a safeblit function.
autoclipped_blit
But you don't always want that.
Especially when two surfaces are the same size.
The only good threads on /g/.
"Good"
Like to DPT?

I would love to just see HTTP and all the scripting languages ditched and the internet can just fuckign start again and do it properly.
So that we don't have horrendous shit like how Facebook it written.
redlizard: I don't have a particular problem with HTTP, I just think it would be great to redesign everything from the ground up.
And that means startign with the protocol.
I would love to see 9P become the standard.
Fucking
Giant response headers
Why are we not providing government-supplied signign agencies and https as standard?
Agreed.
The protocol and security need to be heavily entrenched and designed together.
PAYING to sign yoru sites? Preposterous.
Longlius: And costs are reduced because it's a non-profit organisation.
It must be so fuckign cheap to run a signign agency.
But not free-as-in-freedom
Honestly, signing agencies just make money from havign a reputation as being reliable.
It's the perfect focus for government support.
^
And suddenly
Everybody in the country can have secure communications.
And secure sites.
But, then, maybe that's exactly why they DON'T provide it.
Speaking of which,
Do any of you guys have any suggestions for public key hosting?
redlizard: Literally place a public key on a server with any degree of reputation for being reliable.
Uptime and not being hacked.
It just seems liek a really good idea that I can't find much info about online.
Public key hosting for individuals.
Or by registered email address.
Retrieve key -> Encrypt message -> Send message -> Only intended recipient can open message
Exactly why you need a reliable service to host it.
If it's incorrect you can always email back saying it's the wrong key.
And you can always check for yourself that it's the correct key.
redlizard: lack of access to the email account.
redlizard: This is the same problem as the initial login over SSH.
You may as well say it's not worth going out of your house to buy a better lock because your current lock is only mediocre.
Email notification to confirm.
It's encrypted.
So attackers now need two passwords.
Or, at least, a password and an ability to MITM.
For your account where your public key is hosted.
mf: HTTPS
redlizard: Obviously not.
Or requiring a letter sent to yoru address.
To be signed and returned.
Like how a government would do it.
If it was a government-run program they would know who you are.
And if I looked up the address and found it was taken you'd be accountable for fraud.
But nobody would ever take it that far.
You would risk an "its your word against mine" court case over the key to an email address that you probably still don't have access to?
No, you don't.
You only have access to the key authority.
TO STOP A MITM ATTACK
Except you also have the added bonus of your mail provider not being able to read it.
redlizard: So what you're suggesting still requires access to two accounts.
Access to the email through whatever purpose and access to the public key holder.
So it offers no protection against an INITIAL attack.
But thereafter it does.
If you have a MITM on any current account your'e fucked anyway.
It doesn't unfuck you magically.
Except to publically denounce the key and tell the authority that it's been compromised.
You guys are picking problems in systems that already exist.
Can't you just admit that it requires more work on the part of an attacker to have a public key published?
You're bringing up issues that are problems without a public key published.
WAIT
It's not supposed to protect you.
It's supposed to protect the sender.
If somebody MITMs the sender they can't read the sender's message.
Until you get to any Lisp that isn't Scheme.

If it were possible to get an accurate date for the start of the universe I'd happily use terms relative to that.

redlizard is in the closet about being ENTERPRISE
That's true.
He's not a flaming ENTERPRISE queen.
He's one of those reepectable ENTERPRISE that just looks at sordid pictures of UML in the privacy of his own home.
You can say that C is elegant and you can say that C++ is elegant and mean completely different things.
C++ is surely mroe expressive, if that's what you want.
I just like my expressive languages a little more... expressive. ;)
No, because I don't always want an extremely expressive language.
Expressiveness has a cost.
And I often would prefer to minimise that cost.
Still, in situations in which I would have considered C++ before I would now probably use Haskell or Common Lisp...
Or even Python and inline some C.
I've been wantign to try that for a while.
Hrm.
Are we talking about C++ specifically or all languages?
Because C++ doesn't bring in much abstraction compared to some languages.
I should probably draw up a chart some time
My preferred language by expressiveness
When I would pick which tools.
If only because it would give me a chance to sort my own ideas into tangible form.
My personal experience with C++ is that the further you push it for expressiveness the worse-for-wear your reliable abstraction becomes.
And the less readable yoru code becoems for other people...
redlizard: The trouble for me is that C++ has _so many_ features that I've forgotten more than I'll use in most projects.
So using them often requires a refresher course every time I use it.
Sure
But C++ has A LOT MORE to remember than Python.
The syntax alone.
I know for a fact that around 2001 I wrote a very interesting little AI piece makign extensive use of templates.
Can't remember the first thign about using them now.
Why? because I can't remember all the huge syntax I need ot remember to use C++?
The problem isn't clarity.
Oh, yes, another slight problem with C++'s size and complexity.
The documentation suffers.
man std::string
As far as I can tell, that's just a doxygen auto-generated manual page.
It's not even usable.
http://ompldr.org/vZjN5YQ
Compare
man string.h
Not exactly a problem with the language /per se/, but a problem worsened by the language.
redlizard: The point is that the expressiveness causes complexity, which causes you to need a lot of documentation.
That page is still absolutely terrible...
It's just a huge mess of hundreds and hundreds of functions nobody ever uses.
If C were the only alternative language.
And your problem with that is what? What string.h has less functionality?
I'd rather read perldoc than what you posted.
Excuse the swearing.
moghar: And I think we can both agree that Perl offers more string-processing functionality than std::string.
redlizard: Which is just proof that it's not QT's fault the documentation is a mess.

Genuinely love this band.
They write songs about AI vs. Humanity wars and mankind travelling to colonise neighbouring stars.
Oni_: It's a Windows problem.
I believe that's the "my OS makes my filesystem case-sensitive" bug.
HFS+
case-insensitive*
Basically, we have two versions of a couple of books and they're uppercase and lower case.
Like, the 2nd edition is lower-case and the 3rd-edition is uppercase.
None of us had problems with it because our operatign systems don't treat us like babies who can't deal with case sensitivity.
So now every Windows and OS X user has a problem wit hthe torrent.
It's almost certainly redlizard's fault.
redlizard: http://youtu.be/2exXBdU-6a4
Opening lyrics:
System online, checksum analyze,
Anomaly identified!
Humanity with kill switch capacity,

Oni_: There was talk of changing it but the torrent got a bit... successful.
We;re not used to success around hereand it scared us.
redlizard: Honestly, these guys remind me of Iron Maiden when iron Maiden were still releasing songs about great literature.
redlizard: Apparently we were on Demonoid?
So that figure will be hugely inaccurate.

Petit_Dejeuner: The self-referential feedback that is essential to intelligent thought.
Ah, that's why it sucks.
Petit_Dejeuner: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel_escher_bach
OK, I have to go to bed I guess.
Catch you guys soon-ish.
Just so that you alternative language hipsters know...
How people feel about Delphi and Pascal now...
That's what happens to languages like Go and Haskell that never catch on.
Beautiful languages that other people just never get.
Or, rather, that fade.
So if you use a language that everybody just stops using a few years ago you'll end up like these guys writing Pascal in 2012.
from now*
With peopel going FFS WHY'D HE WRITE IT IN FUCKING PASCAL?
I think Clojure looks interesting, actually.
Scheme.
